    "She sends me blue valentines all the way from Philadelphia",
    "to mark the anniversary of someone that I used to be",
    "And it feels like a warrant is out for my arrest",
    "baby you got me checkin in my rearview mirror",
    "thats why I'm always on the run it's why I changed my name",
    "and I didn't think you'd ever find me here",
    "to send me blue valentines like half forgotten dreams",
    "like a pebble in my shoe as I walk these streets",
    "and the ghost of your memory baby its the thistle in the kiss",
    "its the burglar that can break a rose's neck",
    "its the tatooed broken promise I gotta hide beneath my sleeve",
    "I'm gonna see you every time I turn my back",
    "oh you send me blue valentines though I try to remain at large",
    "they're insisting that our love must have a eulogy",
    "why do I save all this madness here in the nightstand drawer",
    "there to haunt upon my shoulders",
    "baby I know I'd be luckier to walk around everywhere I go",
    "with this blind and broken heart",
    "that sleeps beneath my lapel",
    "instead these blue valentines to remind me of my cardinal sin",
    "i can never wash the guilt or get these bloodstains off my hands",
    "and it takes a whole lot of whiskey to make these nightmares go away",
    "and I cut my bleedin heart out every night and I'm gonna die just a little more",
    "on each St. Valentine's day",
    "don't you remember I promised I would write you",
    "these blue valentines",
    "blue valentines",
    "blue valentines"
