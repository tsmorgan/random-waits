    "A good man is hard to find",
    "Only strangers sleep in my bed",
    "My favorite words are good-bye",
    "And my favorite color is red",
    "I always play Russian Roulette in my head",
    "It's seventeen black and twenty-nine red",
    "How far from the gutter; how far from the pew",
    "I'll always remember to forget about you",
    "A good man is hard to find",
    "Only strangers sleep in my bed",
    "My favorite words are good-bye",
    "And my favorite color is red",
    "A long dead soldier looks out from the frame",
    "No one remembers his war; no one",
    "remembers his name",
    "Go out to the meadow; scare off all the crows",
    "It does nothing but rain here, and nothing",
    "will grow",
    "A good man is hard to find",
    "Only strangers sleep in my bed",
    "My favorite words are good-bye",
    "And my favorite color is red"
