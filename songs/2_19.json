    "I lost everything I had",
    "in the '29 flood",
    "the barn was buried",
    "beneath a mile of mud",
    "now I've got nothing",
    "but the whistle and the steam",
    "my baby leaving town on the 2:19",
    "now there's a fellow that's preaching",
    "about hell and damnation",
    "bouncing off the walls",
    "in the grand central station",
    "I treated her bad",
    "I treated her mean",
    "my baby leaving town on the 2:19",
    "I said hey hey",
    "I don't know what to do",
    "hey hey",
    "I will remember you",
    "hey hey",
    "I don't know what to do",
    "my baby leaving town on the 2:19",
    "now I've always been puzzled",
    "by the yin and the yang",
    "it'll come out in the wash",
    "but it always leaves a stain",
    "sturm and drang",
    "the luster and the sheen",
    "my baby leaving town on the 2:19",
    "lost the baby with the water",
    "and the preacher stole the bride",
    "sent her out for a bottle",
    "but when she came back inside",
    "she didn't have my whiskey",
    "she didn't have my gin",
    "with a hat full of feathers",
    "and a wicked grin",
    "I said hey hey",
    "I don't know what to do",
    "hey hey",
    "I will remember you",
    "hey hey",
    "I don't know what to do",
    "my baby leaving town on the 2:19",
    "on the train you get smaller",
    "as you get farther away",
    "the roar covers everything",
    "you wanted to say",
    "was that a raindrop in",
    "the corner of your eye",
    "were you drying your nails",
    "or waving goodbye",
    "I said hey hey",
    "I don't know what to do",
    "hey hey",
    "I will remember you",
    "hey hey",
    "I don't know what to do",
    "my baby leaving town on the 2:19"
