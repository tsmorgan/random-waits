    "You're the tree that you can't eat the fruit from",
    "I heard horses came to ride me away",
    "I want shade and a good place to shoot from",
    "if it's a clock I'd be the end of the day",
    "you know you're not the boss of me",
    "you can lift your skirt you can shake your hair",
    "I got all the time in the world",
    "you're the ditch in the road where wheels keep spinning",
    "you're the same dead cat clawing its way back grinning",
    "you know you got a bad reputation and your nine lives way down the line",
    "I got a jacket to put on and a hat to wear",
    "I wouldn't waste a gallon on you out there",
    "I got all the time in the world",
    "a bridge is only there for you to jump off of",
    "there ain't no rain clouds that are blue",
    "I do declare my independence baby",
    "I shot off all my fireworks for you",
    "the river's burning and the trees are on fire",
    "there's lots of good rubber left on these tires",
    "and I've got all the time in the world",
    "baby you're the light that won't change",
    "that I got stuck at",
    "you're the fan that won't work at the motel",
    "they were all out of red so I got me a blue one",
    "baby you're always using mine",
    "why don't you get you one",
    "I know you won't go very far",
    "you left your blonde wig in the car",
    "and I got all the time in the world"
