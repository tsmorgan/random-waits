    "The smart money's on Harlow",
    "And the moon is in the street",
    "And the shadow boys",
    "Are breakin' all the laws",
    "Oh and it's east of East St. Louis",
    "And the wind is making speeches",
    "And the rain sounds",
    "Like a round of applause",
    "And Napoleon is weeping",
    "In a carnival saloon",
    "His invisible fianc√©e",
    "Is in the mirror",
    "And the band is goin' home",
    "It's raining hammers",
    "It's raining nails",
    "It's true there's nothing",
    "Left for him down here",
    "And it's time time time",
    "And it is time",
    "And it's time",
    "And it's time time",
    "That you love",
    "And it's time time time",
    "And they all pretend they're orphans",
    "And their memory's like a train",
    "You can see them getting",
    "Smaller as they pull away",
    "Oh and the things you can't remember",
    "Tell the things you can't forget",
    "That history puts a saint",
    "In every dream",
    "Oh she said she'd stick around",
    "Till the bandages came off",
    "But these mama's boys",
    "Just don't know when to quit",
    "And Matilda asks the sailors",
    "Are those dreams or are those prayers",
    "Close your eyes son and this won't hurt a bit",
    "And it's time time time",
    "And it's time time time",
    "And it's time time that you love",
    "And it's time time time",
    "Oh and things are pretty lousy",
    "For the calendar girls",
    "The boys just dive right off the cars",
    "And splash into the street",
    "Oh and when she's on a roll",
    "She pulls a razor from her boot",
    "And a thousand pigeons",
    "Fall around her feet",
    "So put a candle in the window",
    "And a kiss upon my lips",
    "As the dish outside the window",
    "Fills with rain",
    "Oh and just like a stranger",
    "With the weeds in your heart",
    "Pay the fiddler off",
    "Till I come back again",
    "And it's time time time",
    "And it is time time time",
    "And it's time time time that you love",
    "And it's time time time",
    "And it's time time time",
    "And it is time time time",
    "And it's time time time that you love",
    "And it's time time time"
