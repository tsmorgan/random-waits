  "lyrics": [
    "I come in on a night train with an arm full of boxcars",
    "on the wings of a magpie cross a hooligan night",
    "and I busted up a chifferobe way out by the kokomo",
    "cooked up a mess of mulligan and got into a fight",
    "whistlin' past the graveyard steppin' on a crack",
    "me and mother hubbard papa one-eyed Jack",
    "you probably seen me sleepin out by the railroad tracks",
    "go on and ask the prince of darkness",
    "what about all that smoke come from the stack",
    "sometimes I kill myself a jackal suck out all the blood",
    "steal myself a station wagon drivin' through the mud",
    "I'm gonna be whistlin' past the graveyard steppin' on a crack",
    "me and mother hubbard papa one-eyed Jack",
    "I know you seen my headlights and the honkin of my horn",
    "I'm callin out my bloodhounds chase the devil through the corn",
    "last night I chugged the Mississippi now that suckers dry as a bone",
    "I was born in a taxi cab I'm never goin home",
    "Whistlin' past the graveyard steppin' on a crack",
    "me and mother hubbard Papa one-eyed Jack",
    "my eyes have seen the glory of the draining of the ditch",
    "I only come to Baton Rouge I gotta find myself a witch",
    "I'm gonna snatch me up a couple of em every time it rains",
    "you'll see a locomotive probably thinkin its a train",
    "whistlin' past the graveyard steppin' on a crack",
    "me and mother hubbard Papa one-eyed Jack",
    "what you think is the sunshine is just a twinkle in my eye",
    "that ring around my fingers called the fourth of July",
    "when I get a little bit lonesome and a tear falls from my cheek",
    "there's gonna be an ocean in the middle of the week",
    "whistlin' past the graveyard steppin' on a crack",
    "me and mother hubbard Papa one-eyed Jack",
    "I come into town on a night train with an arm full of boxcars",
    "on the wings of a magpie cross a hooligan night",
    "I'm gonna tear me off a rainbow and wear it for a tie",
    "I never told the truth so I can never tell a lie",
    "whistlin' past the graveyard steppin' on a crack",
    "me and mother hubbard Papa one-eyed Jack"
