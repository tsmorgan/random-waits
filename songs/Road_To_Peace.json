    "Young Abdel Madi Shabneh was only 18 years old",
    "the youngest of 9 children",
    "he'd never spent a night away from home",
    "and his mother held his photograph",
    "up in the New York Times",
    "you see the killing has intensified",
    "along the road to peace",
    "a tall thin boy with a wispy moustache",
    "disguised as an Orthodox Jew",
    "on a crowded bus in Jerusalem",
    "some had survived World War II",
    "and the thunderous explosion",
    "blew out windows 200 yards away",
    "more retribution and 17 dead",
    "along the road to peace",
    "now at King George Avenue and Jaffa Road",
    "passengers boarded bus 14A",
    "in the aisle next to the driver Abdel Madi Shabneh",
    "the last thing that he said on earth",
    "was God is great and God is good",
    "and he blew them all to kingdom come",
    "upon the road to peace",
    "now in response to this",
    "another kiss of death was visited upon",
    "Yashir Tehah Israel said is an",
    "Hamas Senior militant",
    "Israel sent 4 choppers in",
    "flames engulfed his white Opel",
    "and it killed his wife and his 3-year-old child",
    "leaving only blackened skeletons",
    "they found a toddler's bottle",
    "and a pair of small shoes",
    "and they waved them in front of the cameras",
    "but Israel said they did not know that",
    "his wife and child were in the car",
    "there are roadblocks everywhere",
    "and only suffering on TV",
    "neither side will ever give up their smallest right",
    "along the road to peace",
    "Israel launched its latest campaign",
    "against Hamas on Tuesday",
    "two days later Hamas shot back",
    "and killed five Israeli soldiers",
    "though thousands dead and wounded on both sides",
    "most of them Middle Eastern civilians",
    "they fill their children full of hate",
    "to fight an old man's war and die",
    "upon the road to peace",
    "this is our land we will fight with all our force",
    "say the Palastinians and the Jews",
    "and each side will cut off the hand of",
    "anyone who tries to stop the resistance",
    "if the right eye offends thee",
    "then you must pluck it out",
    "And Machoud Abbas and Sharon had been lost",
    "along the road to peace",
    "once Kissinger said",
    "we have no friends",
    "America only has interests",
    "and now our president wants to be seen as a hero",
    "and he's hungry for re-election",
    "Bush is reluctant to risk his future",
    "with the fear of his political failures",
    "so he plays chess at his desk",
    "and poses for the press",
    "ten thousand miles",
    "from the road to peace",
    "in a video that they found",
    "at the home of Abdel Madi Shabneh",
    "he held a Kalashnikov rifle",
    "and he spoke with the voice like a boy",
    "he was an excellent student",
    "he studied so hard",
    "it was as if he had a future",
    "he told his mother",
    "he had a test that day",
    "out along the road to peace",
    "the fundamentalist killing on both sides",
    "is standing in the path of peace",
    "and tell me",
    "why are we arming the Israeli army",
    "with guns and tanks and bullets",
    "if God is great and God is good",
    "why can't he change the hearts of men",
    "well maybe God himself",
    "is lost and needs help",
    "maybe God himself",
    "he needs all of our help",
    "maybe God himself",
    "is lost and needs help",
    "he's out upon the road to peace",
    "maybe God himself is lost and needs help",
    "maybe God himself he needs all of our help",
    "and he's lost upon the road to peace",
    "and he's lost upon the road to peace",
    "out upon the road to peace"
