    "I never saw the morning 'til I stayed up all night",
    "I never saw the sunshine 'til you turned out the light",
    "I never saw my hometown until I stayed away too long",
    "I never heard the melody until I needed the song",
    "I never saw the white line 'til I was leaving you behind",
    "I never knew I needed you until I was caught up in a bind now",
    "I never spoke \"I love you\" 'til I cursed you in vain",
    "I never felt my heart strings until I nearly went insane",
    "I never saw the east coast until I moved to the west",
    "I never saw the moonlight until it shone off of your breast",
    "I never saw your heart until someone tried to steal, tried to steal it away",
    "I never saw your tears until they rolled down your face",
    "I never saw the morning 'til I stayed up all night",
    "I never saw the sunshine 'til you turned out your love light, baby",
    "I never saw my hometown 'til I stayed away too long",
    "I never heard the melody until I needed the song"
