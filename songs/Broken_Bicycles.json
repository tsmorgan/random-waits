    "Broken bicycles",
    "old busted chains",
    "with rusted handlebars",
    "out in the rain",
    "somebody must have",
    "an orphanage for",
    "all these things that",
    "nobody wants any more",
    "September is reminding July",
    "it's time to be saying goodbye",
    "summer is gone",
    "but our love will remain",
    "like old broken bicycles",
    "out in the rain",
    "broken bicycles",
    "don't tell my folks",
    "there's all those playing cards",
    "pinned to the spokes",
    "laid down like skeletons",
    "out on the lawn",
    "the wheels won't turn",
    "when the other has gone",
    "the seasons can turn on a dime",
    "somehow I forget every time",
    "for all the things that",
    "you've given me",
    "will always stay",
    "broken but I'll never throw them away"
