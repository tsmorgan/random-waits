    "Well she's up against the register",
    "with an apron and a spatula",
    "with yesterday's deliveries",
    "and the tickets for the bachelors",
    "she's a moving violation",
    "from her conk down to her shoes",
    "but it's just an invitation to the blues",
    "and you feel just like Cagney",
    "looks like Rita Hayworth",
    "at the counter of the Schwab's Drugstore",
    "you wonder if she might be single",
    "she's a loner likes to mingle",
    "got to be patient and pick up a clue",
    "she says howyougonnalikem,",
    "over medium or scrambled",
    "anyways the only way",
    "be careful not to gamble",
    "on a guy with a suitcase",
    "and a ticket gettin out of here",
    "it's a tired bus station",
    "and an old pair of shoes",
    "but it ain't nothin but an",
    "invitation to the blues",
    "but you can't take your eyes off her",
    "get another cup of java",
    "and it's just the way she pours it for you",
    "jokin with the customers",
    "and it's mercy mercy Mr. Percy",
    "there ain't nothin back in Jersey",
    "but a broken down jalopy of a",
    "man I left behind",
    "and a dream that I was chasin",
    "and a battle with the booze",
    "and an open invitation to the blues",
    "but she's had a sugar daddy",
    "and a candy apple caddy",
    "and a bank account and everything",
    "accustom to the finer things",
    "he probably left her for a socialite and",
    "he didn't love her cept at night",
    "and then he's drunk and never",
    "even told her that he cared",
    "So they took the registration",
    "and the car keys and her shoes",
    "and left her with an invitation",
    "to the blues",
    "but there's a Continental Trailways leaving",
    "local bus tonight, good evening",
    "you can have my seat",
    "I'm stickin round here for awhile",
    "get me a room at the Squire",
    "and the fillin station's hirin",
    "I can eat here every night, what the hell have I got to lose",
    "got a crazy sensation",
    "go or stay, and I've got to choose",
    "and I'll accept your invitation",
    "to the blues"
