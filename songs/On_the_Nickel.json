    "Sticks and stones will break my bones I always will be true",
    "and when your mama's dead and gone I'll sing this lullaby just for you",
    "and what becomes of all the little boys who never comb their hair",
    "they're lined up all around the block on the nickel over there",
    "so better bring a bucket there's a hole in the pail",
    "and if you don't get my letter then you'll know that I'm in jail",
    "and what becomes of all the little boys who never say their prayers",
    "they're sleepin like a baby on the nickel over there",
    "and if you chew tobacco and wish upon a star",
    "you'll find out where the scarecrows sit just like punch lines between the cars",
    "and I know a place where a royal flush can never beat a pair",
    "and even Thomas Jefferson is on the nickel over there",
    "so ring around the rosie sleepin in the rain",
    "and you're always late for supper man you let me down let me down again",
    "and I thought I heard a mockingbird Roosevelt knows where",
    "you can skip the light with Grady Tuck on the nickel over there",
    "so what becomes of all the little boys who run away from home",
    "the world just keeps gettin bigger once you get out on your own",
    "so here's to all the little boys the sandman takes you where",
    "you're sleepin with a pillow man on the nickel over there",
    "so climb up through that button hole and fall right up the stairs",
    "and I'll show you where the short dogs grow on the nickel",
    "over there"
