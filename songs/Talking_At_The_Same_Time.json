    "Get a job, save your money, listen to Jane",
    "Everybody knows umbrellas will cost more in the rain",
    "All the news is bad",
    "Is there any other kind?",
    "Everybody’s talking at the same time",
    "Well it’s hard times for some",
    "For others it’s sweet",
    "Someone makes money when there’s blood in the street",
    "Don’t take any lip",
    "Stay in line",
    "Everybody’s talking at the same time",
    "Well the dog is in the kitchen",
    "And the war drags on",
    "The trees wait by the freeway",
    "All the moneys all gone",
    "Well she told me she would leave me",
    "I ignored all the signs",
    "And now everybody’s talking at the same time",
    "Everybody’s talking at the same time",
    "Ain’t no one coming to pull you from the mud",
    "You gotta build your nest high enough to ride out the flood",
    "I know you’re leaving and there’s no more next time",
    "Everybody’s talking at the same time",
    "A tiny boy sat and he played in the sand",
    "He made a sword from a stick",
    "And a gun from his hand",
    "Well we bailed out all the millionaires",
    "They’ve got the fruit",
    "We’ve got the rind",
    "And everybody’s talking at the same time",
    "Everybody’s talking at the same time"
