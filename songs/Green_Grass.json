    "Lay your head where",
    "My heart used to be",
    "Hold the earth above me",
    "Lay down in the green grass",
    "Remember when you loved me",
    "Come closer don't be shy",
    "Stand beneath a rainy sky",
    "The moon is over the rise",
    "Think of me as a train goes by",
    "Clear the thistles and brambles",
    "Whistle didn't he ramble",
    "Now there's a bubble of me",
    "And its floating in thee",
    "Stand in the shade of me",
    "Things are now made of me",
    "The weather vane will say",
    "It smells like rain today",
    "God took the stars and he",
    "Tossed 'em can't tell",
    "The birds from the blossoms",
    "You'll never be free of me",
    "He'll make a tree from me",
    "Don't say good bye to me",
    "Describe the sky to me",
    "And if the sky falls mark",
    "My words â€“ we'll catch mocking birds",
    "Lay your head where",
    "My heart used to be",
    "Hold the earth above me",
    "Lay down in the green grass",
    "Remember when you loved me"
