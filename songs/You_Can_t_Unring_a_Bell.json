    "You can't unring a bell Junior",
    "it'll cost you to get out of this one Junior",

    "cause you you can't unring a bell sucker",
    "you'll need an attorney for this journey Junior",
    "how's it feel",
    "how do you like it in the slam",
    "you're a little man in a great big town",
    "perhaps you were a little hasty",
    "he he he he he he he",
    "you can't take back the things you said man",
    "cause you can't unring a bell junior",

    "take it like a man",
    "get it through your head",
    "suffer",
    "he he he he he he he"
