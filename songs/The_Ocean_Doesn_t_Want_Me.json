    "The ocean doesn't want me today",
    "But I'll be back tomorrow to play",
    "And the strangels will take me",
    "Down deep in their brine",
    "The mischievous braingels",
    "Down into the endless blue wine",
    "I'll open my head and let out",
    "All of my time",
    "I'd love to go drowning",
    "And to stay and to stay",
    "But the ocean doesn't want me today",
    "I'll go in up to here",
    "It can't possibly hurt",
    "All they will find is my beer",
    "And my shirt",
    "A rip tide is raging",
    "And the life guard is away",
    "But the ocean doesn't want me today",
    "The ocean doesn't want me today"
