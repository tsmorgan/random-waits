    "Someday the silver moon and I",
    "Will go to Dreamland",
    "I will close my eyes",
    "And wake up there in Dreamland",
    "But tell me who will put flowers",
    "On a flower's grave",
    "Who will say a prayer",
    "Will I meet a China rose there",
    "In Dreamland",
    "Or does love lie bleeding",
    "In Dreamland",
    "Are these days gone forever and always",
    "If we are to die tonight",
    "Is there moonlight up ahead",
    "And if we are to die tonight",
    "Another rose will bloom",
    "For a faded rose",
    "Will I be the one that you save",
    "I love when it showers",
    "But no one puts flowers",
    "On a flower's grave",
    "As one rose dies another blooms",
    "It's always been that way",
    "I remember the showers",
    "But no one puts flowers",
    "On a flower's grave"
