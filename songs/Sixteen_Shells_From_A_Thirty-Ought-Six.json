    "Plugged sixteen shells from a thirty-ought six",
    "And a black crow snuck through a hole in the sky",
    "And I spent all my buttons on an old pack mule",
    "And I made me a ladder from a pawn shop marimba",
    "I leaned it all up against a dandelion tree",
    "I leaned it all up against a dandelion tree",
    "Gonna whittle you into kindlin'",
    "Sixteen shells from a thirty-ought six",
    "Whittle you into kindlin'",
    "Sixteen shells from a thirty-ought six",
    "Now I slept in the holler of a dry creek bed",
    "And I tore out the buckets from a red corvette",
    "Tore out the buckets from a red corvette",
    "Lionel and Dave and the Butcher made three",
    "Meet me by the knuckles of the skinnybone tree",
    "With the strings of a Washburn like a clothes line",
    "Now me and that mule scrambled right through the hole",
    "Me and that mule scrambled right through the hole",
    "Whittle you into kindlin'",
    "Sixteen shells from a thirty-ought six",
    "Whittle you into kindlin'",
    "Sixteen shells from a thirty-ought six",
    "I will whittle you into kindlin'",
    "Sixteen shells from a thirty-ought six",
    "Whittle you into kindlin'",
    "Sixteen shells from a thirty-ought six",
    "Gonna take a 38 hours long gone train",
    "I just Long gone train",
    "Just long gone train",
    "I just long",
    "Long"
