    "I put my chips on her shoulder",
    "running in the carnival time",
    "she bought the things that I told her",
    "they made her eyes sparkle and shine",
    "together we'll ring in the new year",
    "I know that she'll be my queen",
    "and if I fall asleep in your arms",
    "please wake me up in my dreams",
    "her out-fit was all made of vinyl",
    "like nothing that I've ever seen",
    "when our divorces are final",
    "She'll fit right into my scheme",
    "next to the pawnshop's a chapel",
    "I'll show you just what I mean",
    "and if I fall asleep in your arms",
    "please wake me up in my dreams"
