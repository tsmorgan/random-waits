    "I spent all my money in a Mexican whorehouse baby",
    "cross the street from a Catholic church",
    "and I wiped off my revolver",
    "and I buttoned up my burgundy shirt",
    "I shot the morning in the back with my red wings on",
    "told the sun he better go back down",
    "and if I can find a book of matches",
    "I'm goin to burn this hotel down",
    "you got to tell me brave captain",
    "why are the wicked so strong",
    "how do the angels get to sleep",
    "when the devil leaves his porch light on",
    "well I dropped thirty grand on the nugget slots",
    "I had to sell my ass on Fremont Street",
    "and the drummer said theres sanctuary",
    "over at the bagdad room",
    "oh and now thats one for the money two for the show",
    "three to get ready and go man go",
    "I said tell me mister Siegel",
    "how do I get out of here",
    "Willard's knocked out on a bottle of heat",
    "drivin dangerous curves across the dirty sheets",
    "he said man you ought to see her when her parents are gone",
    "man you ought to hear her when the sirens on",
    "I said tell me brave captain",
    "why are the wicked so strong",
    "how do the angels get to sleep",
    "when the devil leaves the porch light on",
    "don't you know that ain't no broken bottle that I picked up in my headlights",
    "on the other side of the Nevada line",
    "where they live hard die young",
    "and have a good lookin corpse every time",
    "well you know the pit boss said: I should keep movin",
    "this is where you go when you die",
    "so I shot a black beauty",
    "and I kissed her right between the eyes",
    "oh well Willard's knocked out on a bottle of heat",
    "drivin dangerous curves across the dirty sheets",
    "he said when the bitch is wound up and her parents are gone",
    "man you ought to hear her with the siren on",
    "I said tell me brave captain",
    "why are the wicked so strong",
    "how do the angels get to sleep",
    "when the devil leaves his porch light on",
    "I spent all my money now in a Mexican whorehouse",
    "cross the street from a Catholic church",
    "and then I wiped off my revolver",
    "and I buttoned up my burgundy shirt",
    "I shot the morning in the back with my red wings on",
    "I told the sun he'd better go back down",
    "and if I can find a book of matches",
    "I'm goin to burn this hotel down",
    "well it's one for the money two for the show",
    "I said three to get ready and go man go",
