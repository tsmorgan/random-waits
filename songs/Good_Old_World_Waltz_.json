    "When I was a boy,",
    "the moon was a pearl",
    "the sun a yellow gold.",
    "But when I was a man,",
    "the wind blew cold",
    "the hills were upside down",
    "but now that I have gone from here",
    "there's no place I'd rather be",
    "than to float my chances on the tide",
    "Back in the good old world",
    "On October's last,",
    "I'll fly back home",
    "rolling down winding way",
    "And all I've got's a pocket full",
    "of flowers on my grave",
    "But now summer is gone",
    "I remember it best",
    "Back in the good old world",
    "I remember when,",
    "she held my hand",
    "and we walked home alone in the rain",
    "how pretty her mouth, how soft her hair",
    "nothing can be the same",
    "and there's a rose upon her breast",
    "where I long to lay my head",
    "and her hair was so yellow",
    "and the wine was so red",
    "Back in the good old world"
