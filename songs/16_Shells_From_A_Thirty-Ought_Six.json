    "I plugged 16 shells from a thirty-ought-six",
    "and the Black Crow snuck through",
    "a hole in the sky",
    "so I spent all my buttons on an",
    "old pack mule",
    "and I made me a ladder from",
    "a pawn shop marimba",
    "and I leaned it up against",
    "a dandelion tree",
    "and I filled me a sachel",
    "full of old pig corn",
    "and I beat me a billy",
    "from an old French horn",
    "and I kicked that mule",
    "to the top of the tree",
    "and I blew me a hole",
    "'bout the size of a kickdrum",
    "and I cut me a switch from a",
    "long branch elbow",
    "I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin'",
    "Black Crow, sixteen shells from a thirty-ought-six",
    "whittle you into kindlin'",
    "Black Crow sixteen shells from a thirty-ought-six",
    "Well I slept in the holler",
    "of a dry creek bed",
    "and I tore out the buckets",
    "from a red Corvette, tore out the buckets from",
    "a red Corvette",
    "Lionel and Dave and the Butcher made three",
    "you got to meet me by the knuckles of the skinnybone",
    "tree",
    "with the strings of a Washburn",
    "stretched like a clothes line",
    "you know me and that mule scrambled right through",
    "the hole",
    "I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin'",
    "Black Crow, sixteen shells from a thirty-ought-six",
    "whittle you into kindlin'",
    "Black Crow sixteen shells from a thirty-ought-six",
    "Now I hold him prisoner",
    "in a Washburn jail",
    "that strapped on the back of my old kick mule",
    "I bang on the strings just",
    "to drive him crazy",
    "I strum it loud to rattle his cage",
    "strum it loud just to rattle his cage",
    "I'm gonna whittle you into kindlin'",
    "Black Crow, sixteen shells from a thirty-ought-six",
    "whittle you into kindlin'",
