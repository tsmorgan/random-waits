    "The jigolo's jumpin salty",
    "ain't no trade out on the streets",
    "half past the unlucky",
    "and the hawk's a front row seat",
    "dressed in full orchestration",
    "stage door johnny's got to pay",
    "and send him home",
    "talking bout the one that got away",
    "could a been on easy street",
    "could a been a wheel",
    "with irons in the fire",
    "and all them business deals",
    "but the last of the big time losers",
    "shouted before he drove away",
    "I'll be right back as soon as I crack",
    "the one that got away",
    "the ambulance drivers  don't give a shit",
    "they just want to get off work",
    "and the short stop and the victim",
    "have already gone berserk",
    "and the shroud tailor measures him",
    "for a deep six holiday",
    "the stiff is froze, the case is closed",
    "on the one that got away",
    "Jim Crow's directing traffic",
    "with them cemetery blues",
    "with those peculiar looking trousers",
    "and them old Italian shoes",
    "the wooden kimona was all ready",
    "to drop in San Francisco bay",
    "but now he's mumbling something",
    "all about the one that got away",
    "Costello was the champion",
    "at the St. Moritz Hotel",
    "and the best this side of Fairfax",
    "reliable sources tell",
    "but his reputation is at large",
    "and he's at Ben Frank's every day",
    "waiting for the one that got away",
    "he's got a snake skin sportshirt",
    "and he looks like Vincent Price",
    "with a little piece of chicken",
    "and he's carving off a slice",
    "but someone tipped her off",
    "she'll be doing a Houdini now any day",
    "she shook his hustle",
    "the Greyhound bus'll",
    "take the one that got away",
    "Andre is at the piano",
    "behind the Ivar in the Sewers",
    "with a buck a shot for pop tunes",
    "and a fin for guided tours",
    "he could of been in Casablanca",
    "he stood in line out there all day",
    "but now he's spilling whiskey",
    "and learning songs about the one that got away",
    "well I've lost my equilibrium",
    "my car keys and my pride",
    "tattoo parlor's warm",
    "and so I huddle there inside",
    "the grinding of the buzzsaw",
    "whatchuwanthathingtosay",
    "just don't misspell her name",
    "buddy she's the one that got away"
