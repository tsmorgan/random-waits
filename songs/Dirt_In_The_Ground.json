    "What does it matter, a dream of love",
    "Or a dream of lies",
    "We're all gonna be the same place",
    "When we die",
    "Your spirit don't leave knowing",
    "Your face or your name",
    "And the wind through your bones",
    "Is all that remains",
    "And we're all gonna be",
    "Just dirt on the ground",
    "The quill from a buzzard",
    "The blood writes the word",
    "I want to know am I the sky",
    "Or a bird",
    "'Cause hell is boiling over",
    "And heaven is full",
    "We're chained to the world",
    "And we all gotta pull",
    "And we're all gonna be",
    "...just dirt in the ground",
    "Now the killer was smiling",
    "With nerves made of stone",
    "He climbed the stairs",
    "And the gallows groaned",
    "And the people's hearts were pounding",
    "They were throbbing, they were red",
    "As he swung out over the crowd",
    "I heard the hangman said",
    "We're all gonna be...",
    "Just dirt in the ground",
    "Now Cain slew Abel",
    "He killed him with a stone",
    "The sky cracked open",
    "And the thunder groaned",
    "Along a river of flesh",
    "Can these dry bones live?",
    "Ask a king or a beggar",
    "And the answer they'll give",
    "Is we're all gonna be",
    "Yea yea",
    "We're all gonna be just"
