    "The smoke from the battle fish",
    "and the rain soaked through",
    "and the wheelman left the shore",
    "and barns tumbled and silos flew",
    "across fifteen miles of bad road tar",
    "and Big Bull Trometer hung on to the side",
    "and the pig dogs trembled on Spidey's wild ride",
    "and Big John Jizzum from downtown Chisolm",
    "flew away with old Mrs. Storm",
    "and they found Bird Lundy 'neath a keg of nails",
    "crooked as a dog's hind leg",
    "keeping warm after twenty-nine days",
    "on hard assed bread",
    "he drilled to the big outside",
    "and clung like a tick to his waterfront",
    "life mooned and clouded blued and skied",
    "and all the clocks blew up on Spidey's wild ride",
    "and the hills stood up in a great big three",
    "and left me whipped by the forces that were inside me",
    "loud as the ocean cold as a desk",
    "red as the water on the river of flesh",
    "and he was sewing up his pants while he was shoeing a mule",
    "and he was bucking a head wind gale",
    "but the crooked ass beauty was trapped to the side",
    "and he shook on Spidey's wild ride",
    "and all the statue ass makers and the uprooted trees",
    "and I shouted way up to where the rabbit digs his hole",
    "and the wheelman the jockeys the landlords and thee",
    "were bucking a head wind south",
    "and with nine lives spent he landed on his rent",
    "composed with a steelhead salmon in his mouth",
    "and I never did see another day outside",
    "cause I'd had enough travel on Spidey's wild ride"
