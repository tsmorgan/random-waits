    "Mr. Henry staggers home when the evening's done",
    "He's as poor as a church mouse, high on the Meyer's rum",
    "Tuggin' at his shirttail, jinglin' his church key",
    "Chewin' on a toothpick, on another binge",
    "Tramplin' the rosebush, whistlin' to himself",
    "Now don't wake up the neighbors, spittin' on the hinge",
    "Rattlin' the milk bottles and trippin' on a skate",
    "Hidin' from the newsboy before it's too late",
    "The screen door's open, don't make no noise in the kitchen",
    "Got no excuse for a cold gray wife that starts bitchin'",
    "That the no good bum is at it again",
    "After she's given him all the best years of her life",
    "He'll tell her he was celebrating Savage's divorce",
    "Played a hunch out at Yonkers, you can never trust a horse",
    "And thrown in jail, and swore he'd never do these things again",
    "He's got an alibi, but never tells her where he's been",
    "\"Henry!\"",
    "\"Henry!\""
