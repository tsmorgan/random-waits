    "Well, I wish I was in New Orleans",
    "I can see it in my dreams",
    "arm in arm down Burgundy",
    "a bottle and my friends and me",
    "hoist up a few tall cool ones",
    "play some pool and listen to that",
    "tenor saxophone calling me home",
    "and I can hear the band begin",
    "When The Saints Go Marching In",
    "by the whiskers on my chin",
    "New Orleans I'll be there",
    "I'll drink you under the table",
    "be  red nose go for walks",
    "the old haunts what I wants",
    "is red beans and rice",
    "and wear the dress I like so well",
    "meet me at the old saloon",
    "make sure there's a Dixie moon",
    "New Orleans I'll be there",
    "and deal the cards roll the dice",
    "if it ain't that ole Chuck E. Weiss",
    "and Clayborn Avenue me and you",
    "Sam Jones and all",
    "and I wish I was in New Orleans",
    "I can see it in my dreams",
    "arm in arm down Burgundy",
    "a bottle and my friends and me",
    "New Orleans, I'll be there"
