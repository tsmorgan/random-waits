    "Friday left me fumbling with the blues",
    "And it's hard to win when you always lose",
    "Because the nightspots spend your spirit",
    "Beat your head against the wall",
    "Two dead ends and you've still got to choose",
    "You know the bartenders they all know my name",
    "And they catch me when I'm pulling up lame",
    "And I'm a pool-shooting-shimmy-shyster shaking my head",
    "When I should be living clean instead",
    "You know the ladies I've been seeing off and on",
    "Well they spend your love and then they're gone",
    "You can't be lovin' someone who is savage and cruel",
    "Take your love and then they leave on out of town, no they do",
    "Well now falling in love is such a breeze",
    "But its standing up that's so hard for me",
    "I wanna squeeze you but I'm scared to death I'd break your back",
    "You know your perfume well it won't let me be",
    "And you know the bartenders all know my name",
    "And they catch me when I'm pulling up lame",
    "And I'm a pool-shooting-shimmy-shyster shaking my head",
    "When I should be living clean instead",
    "Well, come on baby let your love light shine",
    "Gotta bury me inside of your fire",
    "Because your eyes are enough to blind me",
    "You're like a-looking at the sun",
    "You gotta whisper tell me I'm the one",
    "Come on and whisper tell me I'm the one",
    "Gotta whisper tell me I'm the one",
    "Come on and whisper tell me I'm the one"
