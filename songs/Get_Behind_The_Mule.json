    "Molly be damned smote Jimmy the Harp",
    "With a horrid little pistol and a lariat",
    "she's goin to the bottom",
    "and she's goin down the drain",
    "Said she wasn't big enough to carry it",
    "She got to get behind the Mule",
    "in the morning and plow",
    "She got to get behind the Mule",
    "in the morning and plow",
    "She got to get behind the Mule",
    "in the morning and plow",
    "She got to get behind the Mule",
    "in the morning and plow",
    "Choppity chop goes the axe in the woods",
    "You gotta meet me by the fall down tree",
    "Shovel of dirt upon a coffin lid",
    "and I know they'll come lookin for me boys",
    "and I know they'll come a-lookin for me",
    "Got to get behind the Mule",
    "in the morning and plow",
    "Got to get behind the Mule",
    "in the morning and plow",
    "Got to get behind the Mule",
    "in the morning and plow",
    "Got to get behind the Mule",
    "in the morning and plow",
    "Big Jack Earl was 8'1'",
    "He stood in the road and he cried",
    "He couldn't make her love him",
    "Couldn't make her stay",
    "but tell the good Lord that he tried",
    "(Chorus)",
    "Dusty trail from Atchison to Placerville",
    "On the wreck of the Weaverville stage",
    "Beaula fired on Beatty for a lemonade",
    "I was stirring my brandy with a nail boys",
    "Stirring my brandy with a nail",
    "(Chorus)",
    "Well the rampaging sons of the widow James",
    "Jack the cutter and the pock marked kid",
    "Had to stand naked at the bottom",
    "Of the cross",
    "And tell the good lord what they did",
    "Tell the good lord what they did",
    "(Chorus)",
    "Punctuated birds on the power line",
    "In a Studebaker with the Birdie Joe Hoaks",
    "I'm diggin all the way to China",
    "With a silver spoon",
    "While the hangman fumbles with the noose, boys",
    "The hangman fumbles with the noose",
    "(Chorus)",
    "Pin your ear to the wisdom post",
    "Pin your eye to the line",
    "Never let the weeds get higher",
    "than the garden",
    "Always keep a sapphire in your mind",
    "Always keep a diamond in your mind",
    "(Chorus)"
