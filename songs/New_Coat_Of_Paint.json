    "Let's put a new coat of paint",
    "On this lonesome old town",
    "Set 'em up, we'll be knocking 'em down",
    "You wear a dress",
    "Baby I'll wear a tie",
    "We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon",
    "In that Burgundy sky",
    "All our scribbled love dreams",
    "Are lost or thrown away",
    "Here amidst the shuffle",
    "Of an overflowing day",
    "Love needs a transfusion",
    "Let's shoot it full of wine",
    "Fishing for a good time",
    "Starts with throwing in your line",
    "So let's put a new coat of paint",
    "On this lonesome old town",
    "Set 'em up, set 'em up, we'll be knocking 'em down",
    "You wear a dress baby",
    "I'll wear a tie",
    "We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon",
    "In that burgundy sky"
