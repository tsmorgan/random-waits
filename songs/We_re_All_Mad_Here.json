    "Hang me in a bottle like a cat",
    "Let the crows pick me clean but for my hat",
    "Where the wailing of a baby",
    "Meets the footsteps of the dead",
    "We're all mad here",
    "As the Devil sticks his flag into the mud",
    "Mrs. Carroll has run off with Reverend Judd",
    "Hell is such a lonely place",
    "And your big expensive face",
    "Will never last",
    "And you'll die with the rose still on your lips",
    "And in the time the heart-shaped bone",
    "That was your hips",
    "And all the worms they will climb",
    "The rugged ladder of your spine",
    "We're all mad here",
    "And my eyeballs roll this terrible terrain",
    "We're all inside a decomposing train",
    "And your eyes will die like fish",
    "And the shore of your face will turn to bone"
