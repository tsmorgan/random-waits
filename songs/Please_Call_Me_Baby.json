    "The evening fell just like a star",
    "Left a trail behind",
    "You spit as you slammed out the door",
    "If this is love we're crazy",
    "As we fight like cats and dogs",
    "But I just know there's got to be more",
    "So please call me, baby",
    "Wherever you are",
    "It's too cold to be out walking in the streets",
    "We do crazy things when we're wounded",
    "Everyone's a bit insane",
    "I don't want you catching your death of cold",
    "Out walking in the rain",
    "I admit that I ain't no angel",
    "I admit that I ain't no saint",
    "I'm selfish and I'm cruel but you're blind",
    "If I exorcise my devils",
    "Well my angels may leave too",
    "When they leave they're so hard to find",
    "Please call me, baby",
    "Wherever you are",
    "It's too cold to be out walking in the streets",
    "We do crazy things when we're wounded",
    "Everyone's a bit insane",
    "I don't want you catching your death of cold",
    "Out walking in the rain",
    "We're always at each other's throats",
    "You know, it drives me up the wall(1)",
    "Most of the time I'm just blowing off steam",
    "And I wish to God you'd leave me",
    "Baby, I wish to God you'd stay",
    "Life's so different than it is in your dreams",
    "Please call me, baby",
    "Wherever you are",
    "It's too cold to be out walking in the streets",
    "We do crazy things when we're wounded",
    "Everyone's a bit insane",
    "I don't want you catching your death of cold",
    "Out walking in the rain"
