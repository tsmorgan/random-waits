    "There's a crooked street in Houston town",
    "it's a well worn path I've followed down",
    "now there's ruin in my name",
    "I wish I never got off the train",
    "I wished I'd listened to the words you said",
    "don't go down to Fannin Street",
    "don't go down to Fannin Street",
    "don't go down to Fannin Street",
    "oh yeah",
    "you'll be lost and never found",
    "you can never turn around",
    "don't go down to Fannin Street",
    "once I held you in my arms I was sure",
    "till I took that silent step through the gilded door",
    "but the desire to have much more all the glitter and the roar",
    "now I know that this is where the sidewalk ends",
    "don't go down to Fannin Street",
    "don't go down to Fannin Street",
    "don't go down to Fannin Street",
    "you'll be lost and never found",
    "you can never turn around",
    "don't go down to Fannin Street",
    "when I was young I thought only of getting out",
    "I said good-bye to my street",
    "good-bye to my house",
    "give a man gin give a man cards",
    "give an inch he takes a yard",
    "and I rue the day that I stepped off this train",
    "don't go down to Fannin Street",
    "don't go down to Fannin Street",
    "don't go down to Fannin Street",
    "oh yeah",
    "you'll be lost and never found",
    "you can never turn around"
