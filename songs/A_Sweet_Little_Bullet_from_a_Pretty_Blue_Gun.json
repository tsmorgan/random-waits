  "lyrics": [
    "Well it's raining it's pouring",
    "you didn't bring a sweater",
    "Nebraska will never let you come back home",
    "Now on Hollywood and Vine",
    "by the Thrifty Mart sign",
    "any night I'll be willin to bet",
    "there's a young girl",
    "with sweet little dreams and pretty blue wishes",
    "standin there just gettin all wet",
    "Now there's a place off the drag",
    "called the Gilbert Hotel",
    "and there's a couple letters",
    "burned out in the sign",
    "and it's better than a bus stop",
    "they do good business every time it rains",
    "for little girls with nothing in their jeans",
    "but pretty blue wishes and sweet little dreams",
    "and its raining its pouring",
    "the old man is snoring",
    "now I lay me down to sleep",
    "I hear the sirens in the street",
    "all my dreams are made of chrome",
    "I have no way to get back home",
    "I'd rather die before I wake",
    "like Marilyn Monroe(7)",
    "and you could throw my dreams out in the street",
    "and let the rain make 'em grow",
    "now the night clerk he got a club foot",
    "he's heard every hard luck story",
    "at least a hundred times or more",
    "he says check out time is 10 am",
    "and thats just what it means",
    "go on up the stairs",
    "with sweet little wishes and pretty blue dreams",
    "and it's raining its pouring",
    "and Hollywood's just fine",
    "swindle a little girl out of her dreams",
    "another letter in the sign",
    "now never trust a scarecrow wearin shades after dark",
    "be careful of that old bow tie he wears",
    "it takes a sweet little bullet from a pretty blue gun",
    "to put those scarlet ribbons in your hair",
    "no that ain't no cherry bomb",
    "fourth of July's all done",
    "just some fool playin that second line",
    "from the barrel of a pretty blue gun",
    "o that ain't no cherry bomb",
    "fourth of July's all done",
    "just some fool playin that second line",
    "from the barrel of a pretty blue gun"
