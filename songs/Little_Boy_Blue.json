    "Little boy blue",
    "come blow your horn",
    "the dish ran away",
    "with the spoon",
    "home again Saturday morn",
    "he never gets up before noon",
    "well she used to render you",
    "legal and tender",
    "when you used to send her",
    "your promises boy",
    "a diller",
    "a dollar",
    "unbutton your collar",
    "and come out and holler",
    "out all of your noise",
    "so little boy blue",
    "come blow your top",
    "and cut it",
    "right down to the quick",
    "don't sit home and cry",
    "on the fourth of July",
    "around now you're",
    "hitting the bricks",
    "so abracadabra",
    "now she disappeared",
    "everything is canada dry",
    "So watch your behavior",
    "and rattle your cage",
    "With a bottle of bourbon",
    "goodbye",
    "so little boy blue",
    "lost little bo peep",
    "she fell through",
    "a hole in the nest",
    "Now ain't it peculiar",
    "that she is finally cooled",
    "your big wheel is",
    "just like all of the rest",
    "whenever it rains",
    "the umbrellas complain",
    "they always get",
    "played for a chump",
    "so mark it and strike it",
    "she's history now",
    "And you're hanging out",
    "at the pump",
    "little boy blue",
    "come blow your horn",
    "the dish ran away",
    "with the spoon",
    "home again Saturday morn",
    "he never gets up before noon",
    "well she used to render you",
    "legal and tender",
    "when you used to send her",
    "your promises boy",
    "a diller",
    "a dollar",
    "unbutton your collar",
    "and come out and holler",
    "out all of your noise"
