    "Well, I'm walking on down Virginia Avenue",
    "Trying to find somebody to tell my troubles to",
    "Harold's Club is closing, and everybody's going on home",
    "What's a poor boy to do?",
    "I'll just get on back into my short, make it back to the fort",
    "Sleep off all the craziness that's inside of my brain",
    "There's gotta be some place that's better than this",
    "This life I'm leading is driving me insane",
    "And let me tell you I'm dreaming",
    "Let me tell you that I'm dreaming to the twilight",
    "This town has got me down",
    "I've seen all of the highlights, I've been walking all around",
    "I won't make a fuss, I'll take a Greyhound bus",
    "To carry me away from here now",
    "Tell me, what have I got to lose?",
    "Cause I'm walking on down Columbus Avenue",
    "The bars are all closing, cause it's quarter to two",
    "Every town I go to is like a lock without a key",
    "The blues I leave behind keep catching up on me",
    "Let me tell you they're catching up on me",
    "They're catching up on me",
    "Catching up on me",
    "Catching up on me",
    "Catching up on me"
