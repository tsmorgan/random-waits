    "She wore red shoes by the newsstand",
    "as the rain splashed the nickel",
    "and spilled like chablis all along the midway",
    "theres a little bluejay",
    "in a red dress on a sad night",
    "one straw in a root beer",
    "a compact with a cracked mirror",
    "a bottle of evening in paris perfume",
    "what's this sad tune",
    "he told her to wait in by the magazines",
    "to take care of some business it seems",
    "bring a raincoat",
    "bring a suitcase",
    "bring your dark eyes",
    "and wear those red shoes",
    "theres a dark huddle at the bus stop",
    "umbrellas arranged in a sad bouquet",
    "lil Caesar got caught",
    "he was going down to second",
    "he was cooled",
    "changing stations on the chamber",
    "to steal a diamond ring",
    "from a jewelry store for his baby",
    "he loved the way she looked",
    "in those red shoes",
    "she waited by the drugstore",
    "Caesar had never been this late before",
    "the dogs bayed the moon",
    "and rattled their chain",
    "and the cold jingle of taps in a puddle",
    "was the burglar alarm",
    "snitchin on Caesar",
    "the rain washes memories from the sidewalks",
    "and the hounds splash the nickel full of soldiers",
    "and Santa Claus is drunk",
    "in the ski room",
    "and it's Christmas Eve",
    "in a sad caf√©",
    "when the moon gets it's way",
    "there's a little blue jay by the news-stand",
    "red shoes",
    "red shoes",
    "so meet me tonight by the drugstore",
    "meet me tonight by the drugstore",
    "meet me tonight by the drugstore",
    "goin out tonight",
    "goin out tonight",
    "goin out tonight",
    "wear your red shoes",
    "red shoes",
    "red shoes",
    "red shoes",
    "red shoes"
