    "The sky holds all our wishes",
    "the dish ran away with the spoon",
    "chimney smoke ties the roofs to the sky",
    "there's a hole over head",
    "but it's only the moon",
    "will there ever be a tree",
    "grown from the seeds I've sown",
    "life is a path lit only",
    "by the light of those I've loved",
    "by the light of those I love",
    "life's a path lit only by",
    "the light of those I've loved",
    "by the light of those I love"
