    "Poor little lamb",

    "life is an empty cup",
    "poor little lamb",
    "watch your shoulder",
    "coyote's waiting out there",

    "if we don't find a way out of here",

    "where we won't have to be afraid",
    "the world will be on a hummer boys",
    "and we'll laugh and we'll drink lemonade"
