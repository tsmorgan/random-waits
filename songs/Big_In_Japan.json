    "I got the style but not the grace",
    "I got the clothes but not the face",
    "I got the bread but not the butter",
    "I got the winda but not the shutter",
    "But I'm big in Japan I'm big in Japan But heh I'm big in Japan",
    "I got the house but not the deed",
    "I got the horn but not the reed",
    "I got the cards but not the luck",
    "I got the wheel but not the truck",
    "But heh I'm big in Japan I'm big in Japan I'm big in Japan",
    "I got the moon I got the cheese I got the whole damn nation",
    "On its knees I got the rooster I got the crow",
    "I got the ebb I got the flow",
    "I got the powder but not the gun",
    "I got the dog but not the bun",
    "I got the clouds but not the sky",
    "I got the stripes but not the tie",
    "But heh I'm big in Japan I'm big in Japan I'm big in Japan",
    "Heh ho they love the way I do it",
    "Heh ho there's really nothing to it",
    "I got the moon I got the cheese",
    "I got the whole damn nation on their knees",
    "I got the rooster I got the crow",
    "I got the ebb I got the flow",
    "I got the sizzle but not the steak",
    "I got the boat but not the lake",
    "I got the sheets but not the bed",
    "I got the jam but not the bread",
    "But heh I'm big in Japan I'm big in Japan I'm big in Japan",
    "I'm big in Japan, I'm big in Japan."
