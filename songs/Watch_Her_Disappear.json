  "lyrics": [
    "Last night I dreamed that I was dreaming of you",
    "and from a window across the lawn I watched you undress",
    "wearing a sunset of purple tightly woven around your hair",
    "that rose in strangled ebony curls",
    "moving in a yellow Bedroom light",
    "The air is wet with sound",
    "The faraway yelping of a wounded dog",
    "and the ground is drinking a slow faucet leak",
    "Your house is so soft and fading",
    "as it soaks the black summer heat",
    "a light goes on and a door opens",
    "and yellow cat runs out on the stream of hall light",
    "and into the yard",
    "a wooden cherry scent is faintly breathing the air",
    "I hear your champagne laugh",
    "you wear two lavender orchids",
    "one in your hair and one on your hip",
    "a string of yellow carnival lights",
    "comes on with the dusk",
    "circling the lake in a slowly dipping halo",
    "and I hear a Banjo tango",
    "and you dance into the shadow of a Black Poplar Tree",
    "I watch you as you disappear",
    "I watch you as you disappear",
    "I watch you as you disappear..."
