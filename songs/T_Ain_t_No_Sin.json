    "When you hear sweet syncopation",
    "And the music softly moans",
    "T ain't no sin to take off your skin",
    "And dance around in your bones",
    "When it gets too hot for comfort",
    "And you can't get an ice cream cone",
    "'T ain't no sin to take off your skin",
    "And dance around in your bones",
    "Just like those bamboo babies",
    "Down in the South Sea tropic zone",
    "T' ain't no sin to take off your skin",
    "And dance around in your bones",
    "When you hear sweet syncopation, and the music softly moans",
    "'t ain't no sin to take off your skin, and dance around in your bones",
    "When it gets too hot for comfort, and you can't get an ice cream cone",
    "'t ain't no sin to take off your skin, and dance around in your bones",
    "Just like those bamboo babies, down in the South Sea tropic zone",
