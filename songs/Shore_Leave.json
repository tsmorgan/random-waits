    "Well with buck shot eyes and a purple heart",
    "I rolled down the national stroll",
    "and with a big fat paycheck",
    "strapped to my hip-sack",
    "and a shore leave wristwatch underneath my sleeve",
    "in a Hong Kong drizzle on Cuban heels",
    "I rowed down the gutter to the Blood Bank",
    "and I'd left all my papers on the Ticonderoga",
    "and I was in bad need of a shave",
    "and so I slopped at the corner on cold chow mein",
    "and shot billiards with a midget",
    "until the rain stopped",
    "and I bought a long sleeved shirt",
    "with horses on the front",
    "and some gum and a lighter and a knife",
    "and a new deck of cards (with girls on the back)",
    "and I sat down and wrote a letter to my wife",
    "and I said Baby, I'm so far away from home",
    "and I miss my baby so",
    "I can't make it by myself",
    "I love you so",
    "Well I was pacing myself",
    "trying to make it all last",
    "squeezing all the life",
    "out of a lousy two day pass",
    "and I had a cold one at the Dragon",
    "with some Filipino floor show",
    "and talked baseball with a lieutenant",
    "over a Singapore sling",
    "and I wondered how the same moon outside",
    "over this Chinatown fair",
    "could look down on Illinois",
    "and find you there",
    "and you know I love you Baby",
    "and I'm so far away from home",
    "and I miss my baby so",
    "I can't make it by myself",
    "I love you so",
    "Shore Leave...",
    "Shore Leave..."
