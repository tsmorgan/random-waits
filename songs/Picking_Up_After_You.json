    "Here comes the bride and there goes the groom",
    "looks like a hurricane went through this room",
    "smells like a pool hall where's my other shoe",
    "and I'm sick and tired of picking up after you",
    "looks like you spent the night in a trench",
    "and tell me how long have you been",
    "combing your hair with a wrench",
    "the roses are dead and the violets are too",
    "and I'm sick and tired of picking up after you",
    "well I've told you before I won't tell you again",
    "you don't defrost the icebox with a ball point pen",
    "this railroad apartment is held together with glue",
    "and I'm sick and tired of picking up after you",
    "because I know I've been swindled",
    "I never bargained for this",
    "what's more you never cared about me",
    "why don't you get your own place",
    "so you can live like you do",
    "and I'm sick and tired of picking up after you",
    "take all your relatives and all of your shoes",
    "believe me I'll really swing when you're gone",
    "I'll be living on chicken and wine after we're through",
    "with someone I pick up after you"
