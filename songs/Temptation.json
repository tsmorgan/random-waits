    "Rusted brandy in a diamond glass",
    "everything is made from dreams",
    "time is made from honey slow and sweet",
    "only the fools know what it means",
    "temptation, temptation, temptation",
    "oh, temptation, temptation, I can't resist.",
    "I know that she is made of smoke",
    "but I've lost my way",
    "she knows that I am broke",
    "so that I must play",
    "temptation, temptation, temptation",
    "oh, whoa, temptation, temptation, I can't resist.",
    "Dutch pink and Italian blue",
    "she is there waiting for you",
    "my will has disappeared",
    "now my confusions oh so clear",
    "temptation, temptation, temptation",
    "whoa, whoa, temptation, temptation",
    "I can't resist."
