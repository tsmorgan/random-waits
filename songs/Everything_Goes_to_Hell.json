    "Why be sweet, why be careful, why be kind?",
    "A man has only one thing on his mind",
    "Why ask politely, why go lightly, why say please?",
    "They only want to get you on your knees",
    "There are a few things I never could believe",
    "A woman when she weeps",
    "A merchant when he swears",
    "A thief who says he'll pay",
    "A lawyer when he cares",
    "A snake when he is sleeping",
    "A drunkard when he prays",
    "I don't believe you go to heaven when you're good",
    "Everything goes to hell, anyway...",
    "Laissez-faire mi amour, ce la vie",
    "Shall I return to shore or swim back out to sea?",
    "The world don't care what a soldier does in town",
    "It's all hanging in the windows by the pound",
    "There are few things I never could believe...",
    "A woman when she weeps",
    "A merchant when he swears",
    "A thief who says he'll pay",
    "A lawyer when he cares",
    "A snake when he is sleeping",
    "A drunkard when he prays",
    "I don't believe you go to heaven when you're good",
    "Everything goes to hell, anyway...",
    "I only want to hear your purr and to hear you moan",
    "There is another man who brings the money home",
    "I don't want dishes in the sink",
    "Please don't tell me what you feel or",
    "what you think",
    "There are few things I never could believe..."
