  "lyrics": [
    "A cab combs the snake, tryin' to rake in that last night's fare",
    "And a solitary sailor, who spends the facts of his life like small change on strangers",
    "Paws his inside peacoat pocket for a welcome twenty-five cents",
    "And the last bent butt from a package of Kents",
    "As he dreams of a waitress with Maxwell House eyes",
    "And marmalade thighs with scrambled yellow hair",
    "Her rhinestone-studded moniker says \"Irene\"",
    "As she wipes the wisps of dishwater blonde from her eyes",
    "And the Texaco beacon burns on",
    "The steel-belted attendant with a ring and valve special crying",
    "'Fill 'er up and check that oil",
    "You know it could be your distributor and it could be your coil'",
    "The early morning final edition is on the stands",
    "And the town crier is crying there with nickels in his hands",
    "Pigs in a blanket, sixty-nine cents",
    "Eggs, roll 'em over, and a package of Kents",
    "Adam and Eve on a log, you can sink 'em down straight",
    "Hash browns, hash browns, you know I can't be late",
    "And the early dawn cracks out a carpet of diamonds",
    "Across a cash crop car lot, filled with twilight Coupe Devilles",
    "Leaving the town in the keeping",
    "Of the one who is sweeping",
    "Up the ghosts of Saturday night"
