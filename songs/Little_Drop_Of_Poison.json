    "I like my town with a little drop of poison",
    "nobody knows they're lining up to go insane",
    "I'm all alone I smoke my friends down to the filter",
    "but I feel much cleaner after it rains",
    "she left in the fall that's her picture on the wall",
    "she always had that little drop of poison",
    "did the devil make the world while god was sleeping",
    "you'll never get a wish from a bone",
    "another long goodbye and a hundred sailors",
    "that deep blue sky is my home",
    "she left in the fall that's her picture on the wall",
    "she always had that little drop of poison",
    "well the rat always knows when he's in with weasels",
    "here you loose a little every day",
    "well I remember when a million was a million",
    "they all have ways to make you pay",
    "she left in the fall that's her picture on the wall",
    "she always had that little drop of poison",
    "she left in the fall that's her picture on the wall",
    "she always had that little drop of poison"
