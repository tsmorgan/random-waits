    "The prettiest girl",
    "in all the world",
    "is in a little Spanish town",
    "but I left her for a Bonnie lass",
    "and I told her",
    "I'd see her around",
    "But that Bonnie lass",
    "and her heart of glass",
    "would not hold a candle",
    "to bumming around",
    "so don't cry for me",
    "for I'm going away",
    "and I'll be back some lucky day",
    "Tell the boys back home",
    "I'm doing just fine",
    "I left all my troubles and woe",
    "so sing about me",
    "for I can't come home",
    "I've many more miles to go",
    "Why there's Miss Kelsey",
    "you taught dance at our school",
    "and old Johnny O'Toole",
    "I'll still beat you at pool",
    "so don't cry for me",
    "for I'm going away",
    "and I'll be back some lucky day",
    "Now when I was a boy",
    "My daddy sat me on his knee",
    "And he told me",
    "He told me many things",
    "And he said son",
    "There's alot of things in this world",
    "You're gonna have no use for",
    "And when you get blue",
    "And you've lost all your dreams",
    "There's nothin like a campfire",
    "And a can of beans",
    "Why there's Miss Kelsey",
    "She taught dance at our school",
    "And old Johnny O 'Toole",
    "I'll still beat you at pool",
    "So don't cry for me",
    "For I'm goin' away",
    "And I'll be back some lucky day"
