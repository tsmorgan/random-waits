    "Well Frank settled down in the Valley",
    "and he hung his wild years",
    "on a nail that he drove through",
    "his wife's forehead",
    "he sold used office furniture",
    "out there on San Fernando Road",
    "and assumed a $30,000 loan",
    "at 15 _ % and put a down payment",
    "on a little two bedroom place",
    "his wife was a spent piece of used jet trash",
    "made good bloody marys",
    "kept her mouth shut most of the time",
    "had a little Chihuahua named Carlos",
    "that had some kind of skin disease",
    "and was totally blind. They had a thoroughly modern kitchen",
    "self-cleaning oven (the whole bit)",
    "Frank drove a little sedan",
    "they were so happy",
    "One night Frank was on his way home",
    "from work, stopped at the liquor store,",
    "picked up a couple Mickey's Big Mouths",
    "drank 'em in the car on his way",
    "to the Shell station, he got a gallon of",
    "gas in a can,  drove home, doused",
    "everything in the house, torched it,",
    "parked across the street, laughing",
    "watching it burn, all Halloween",
    "orange and chimney red then",
    "Frank put on a top forty station",
    "got on the Hollywood Freeway",
    "headed North",
    "Never could stand that dog"
