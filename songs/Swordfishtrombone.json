    "Well, he came home from the war",
    "with a party in his head",
    "and modified Brougham DeVille",
    "and a pair of legs that opened up",
    "like butterfly wings",
    "and a mad dog that wouldn't",
    "sit still",
    "he went and took up with a Salvation Army",
    "Band girl",
    "who played dirty water",
    "on a swordfishtrombone",
    "he went to sleep at the bottom of",
    "Tenkiller lake",
    "and he said \"gee, but it's",
    "great to be home\"",
    "Well he came home from the war",
    "with a party in his head",
    "and an idea for a fireworks display",
    "and he knew that he'd be ready with",
    "a stainless steel machete",
    "and a half a pint of Ballantine's",
    "each day",
    "And he holed up in room above a hardware store",
    "cryin' nothing there but Hollywood tears",
    "and he put a spell on some",
    "poor little Crutchfield girl",
    "and stayed like that for 27 years",
    "Well he packed up all his",
    "expectations he lit out for California",
    "with a flyswatter banjo on his knee",
    "with lucky tiger in his angel hair",
    "and benzedrine for getting there",
    "they found him in a eucalyptus tree",
    "lieutenant got him a canary bird",
    "and skanked her head with every word",
    "And Chesterfield moonbeams in a song",
    "and he got 20 years for lovin' her",
    "from some Oklahoma governor",
    "said everything this Doughboy",
    "does is wrong",
    "Now some say he's doing",
    "the obituary mambo",
    "and some say he's hanging on the wall",
    "perhaps this yarn's the only thing",
    "that holds this man together",
    "some say he was never here at all",
    "Some say they saw him down in",
    "Birmingham, sleeping in a boxcar going by",
    "and if you think that you can tell a bigger tale",
    "I swear to God you'd have to tell a lie..."
