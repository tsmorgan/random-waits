    "Well ya play that Tarantella",
    "All the hounds they start to roar",
    "And the boys all go to hell",
    "Then the Cubans hit the floor",
    "And they drive along the pipeline",
    "They tango till they're sore",
    "They take apart their nightmares",
    "And they leave them by the door",
    "Let me fall out of the window",
    "With confetti in my hair",
    "Deal out jacks or better",
    "On a blanket by the stairs",
    "I'll tell you all my secrets",
    "But I lie about my past",
    "So send me off to bed forever more",
    "Make sure they play my theme song",
    "I guess daisies will have to do",
    "Just get me to New Orleans",
    "And paint shadows on the pews",
    "Turn the spit on that pig",
    "Kick the drum and let me down",
    "Put my clarinet beneath your bed",
    "Till I get back in town",
    "Let me fall out of the window",
    "With confetti in my hair",
    "Deal out jacks or better",
    "On a blanket by the stairs",
    "I'll tell you all my secrets",
    "But I lie about my past",
    "So send me off to bed forever more",
    "Just make sure she's all in calico",
    "And the colour of a doll",
    "Wave the flag on cadillac day",
    "And a skillet on the wall",
    "Cut me a switch or hold your breath",
    "Till the sun goes down",
    "Write my name on the hood",
    "Send me off to another town",
    "Let me fall out of the window",
    "With confetti in my hair",
    "Deal out jacks or better",
    "On a blanket by the stairs",
    "I'll tell you all my secrets",
    "But I lie about my past",
    "So send me off to bed forever more",
    "Send me off to bed forever more",
    "Send me off to bed forever more",
    "Send me off to bed forever more"
