    "It's dreamy weather we're on",
    "You wave your crooked wand",
    "Along an icy pond",
    "With a frozen moon",
    "A murder of silhouette crows I saw...",
    "And the tears on my face",
    "And the skates on the pond they spell Alice",
    "I'll disappear in your name",
    "But you must wait for me",
    "Somewhere beneath the sea",
    "There's the wreck of a ship",
    "Your hair is like meadow grass",
    "On the tide And the raindrops on my window",
    "And the ice in my drink",
    "Baby, all that I can think of Is Alice",
    "Arithmetic Arithmetock I turn the hands back on the clock",
    "How does the ocean rock the boat",
    "How did the razor find my throat",
    "The only strings that hold me here",
    "Are tangled up around the pier",
    "And so a secret kiss",
    "Brings madness with the bliss",
    "And I will think of this",
    "When I'm dead in my grave",
    "Set me adrift and I'm lost over there",
    "But I must be insane",
    "To go skating on your name",
    "And by tracing it twice",
    "I fell through the ice Of Alice",
    "There's only Alice"
