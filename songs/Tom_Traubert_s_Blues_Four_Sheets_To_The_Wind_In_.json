    "Wasted and wounded, it ain't what the moon did",
    "I got what I paid for now",
    "See ya tomorrow, hey Frank can I borrow",
    "a couple of bucks from you, to go",
    "Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing",
    "Matilda with me",
    "I'm an innocent victim of a blinded alley",
    "and I'm tired of all these soldiers here",
    "no one speaks English, and everything's broken",
    "and my Stacys are soaking wet",
    "to go waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing",
    "Matilda with me",
    "now the dogs are barking",
    "and the taxi cabs parking",
    "a lot they can do for me",
    "I begged you to stab me",
    "you tore my shirt open",
    "and I'm down on my knees tonight",
    "Old Bushmills I staggered,",
    "you buried the dagger in",
    "your silhouette window light to go",
    "waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing",
    "Matilda with me",
    "now I've lost my St. Christopher",
    "now that I've kissed her and the",
    "one-armed bandit knows, and the",
    "maverick Chinaman, and the cold-blooded signs",
    "and the girls down by the strip tease shows go",
    "waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing",
    "Matilda with me",
    "no I don't want your sympathy",
    "the fugitives say that the streets aren't for dreaming now",
    "manslaughter dragnets and the ghosts that sell memories",
    "They want a piece of the action anyhow go",
    "waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing",
    "Matilda with me",
    "and you can ask any sailor",
    "and the keys from the jailer",
    "and the old men in wheelchairs know",
    "that Matilda's the defendant, she killed about a hundred",
    "and she follows wherever you may go",
    "waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda, you'll go waltzing",
    "Matilda with me",
    "and it's a battered old suitcase",
    "to a hotel someplace",
    "and a wound that will never heal",
    "no prima donna, the perfume is on",
    "an old shirt that is stained with blood and whiskey",
    "and goodnight to the street sweepers",
    "the night watchman flame keepers",
    "and goodnight Matilda, too"
