    "The piano has been drinking",
    "my neck tie is asleep",
    "and the combo went back to New York",
    "the jukebox has to take a leak",
    "and the carpet needs a haircut",
    "and the spotlight looks like a prison break",
    "cause the telephone is out of cigarettes",
    "and the balcony is on the make",
    "and the piano has been drinking",
    "the piano has been drinking",
    "and the menus are all freezing",
    "and the lightman's blind in one eye",
    "and he can't see out of the other",
    "and the piano tuner's got a hearing aid",
    "and showed up with his mother",
    "and the piano has been drinking",
    "the piano has been drinking",
    "cause the bouncer is a Sumo wrestler",
    "cream-puff casper milk toast",
    "and the owner is a mental midget with the I.Q. of a fencepost",
    "cause the piano has been drinking",
    "the piano has been drinking",
    "and you can't find your waitress",
    "with a Geiger counter",
    "and she hates you and your friends",
    "and you just can't get served",
    "without her",
    "and the box-office is drooling",
    "and the bar stools are on fire",
    "and the newspapers were fooling",
    "and the ashtrays have retired",
    "and the piano has been drinking",
    "the piano has been drinking",
    "the piano has been drinking",
    "not me, not me, not me, not me, not me"
