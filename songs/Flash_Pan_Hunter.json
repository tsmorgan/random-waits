    "The flash pan hunter sways with the wind",
    "His rifle is the sound of the morning",
    "Each sulfurous bullet way have its own wit",
    "Each cartridge comes with a warning",
    "Beware of elaborate telescopic meats",
    "They will find their way back to the forest",
    "For Wilhelm can't wait",
    "To be Peg Leg's crown",
    "As the briar is strangling",
    "The rose back down",
    "His back shall be my slender new branch",
    "It will sway and bend in the breeze",
    "As the Devil does his Polka",
    "With a hatchet in his hand",
    "As a sniper in the branches of the trees",
    "As the vulture flutters down",
    "As the snake sheds his dove",
    "Wilhelm's cutting off his fingers",
    "So they'll fit into his glove",
    "For Wilhelm can't wait",
    "To be Peg Leg's crown",
    "As the briar is strangling",
    "The rose back down"
