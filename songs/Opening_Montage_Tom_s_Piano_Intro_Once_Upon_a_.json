    "Down through the ages all of the sages",
    "said don't spend your wages on love",
    "it's graft and collusion about the intrusion",
    "and preceding foreclosures there's overexposure",
    "down at the crossroads the question is posed",
    "bridge is washed out and the highway is closed",
    "gotta have good reason to firmly believe",
    "love was designed to exploit and deceive",
    "there's an addendum wherever you send 'em",
    "in your chest you will see",
    "simple addition keeps with tradition",
    "don't spend your wages on love",
    "take any burgh any city or town",
    "just get on main street and drive all the way down",
    "you see love has a graveyard nurtured for those",
    "that fell on their sabers and paid through the nose",
    "your shovel's a shot glass dig your own hole",
    "bury what's left of your miserable soul",
    "down through the ages all of the sages",
    "said don't spend your wages on love",
    "it's graft and collusion about the intrusion",
    "and preceding foreclosure there is overexposure",
    "down at the crossroads the question is posed",
    "and the bridge is washed out and the highway is closed"
