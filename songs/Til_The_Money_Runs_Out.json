    "Check this strange beverage that falls out from the sky",
    "splashin bagdad on the hudson in Panther Martin's eyes",
    "he's high and outside wearin candy apple red",
    "scarlett gave him twenty-seven stitches in his head",
    "with a pint of green chartreuse ain't nothin seems right",
    "you buy the sunday paper on a saturday night",
    "Can't you hear the thunder someone stole my watch",
    "I sold a quart of blood and bought a half a pint of scotch",
    "someone tell those chinamen on Telegraph Canyon Road",
    "when youre on the bill with the spoon there ain't no time to unload",
    "so bye bye baby baby bye bye",
    "droopy stranger lonely dreamer toy puppy and the prado",
    "were laughin as they piled into Olmos eldorado",
    "jesus whispered eeni meany miney moe",
    "they're too proud to duck their heads that's why they bring it down so low",
    "So bye bye baby baby bye bye",
    "the pointed man is smack dab in the middle of July",
    "swingin from the rafters in his brand new tie",
    "he said I can't go back to that hotel room all they do is shout",
    "but I'll stay with you baby till the money runs out",
    "so bye bye baby baby bye bye",
    "so bye bye baby baby bye bye",
    "bye bye bye",
    "by bye baby baby bye bye",
    "bye bye baby baby bye bye",
    "bye bye baby baby bye bye",
    "bye bye baby baby bye bye",
    "bye bye baby baby bye bye",
    "oh bye bye baby",
    "bye bye baby baby bye bye"
