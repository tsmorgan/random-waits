    "When I'm lyin' in my bed at night",
    "I don't wanna grow up",
    "Nothin' ever seems to turn out right",
    "I don't wanna grow up",
    "How do you move in a world of fog",
    "That's always changing things",
    "Makes me wish that I could be a dog",
    "When I see the price that you pay",
    "I don't wanna grow up",
    "I don't ever wanna be that way",
    "I don't wanna grow up",
    "Seems like folks turn into things",
    "that they'd never want",
    "The only thing to live for",
    "Is today...",
    "I'm gonna put a hole in my TV set",
    "I don't wanna grow up",
    "Open up the medicine chest",
    "And I don't wanna grow up",
    "I don't wanna have to shout it out",
    "I don't want my hair to fall out",
    "I don't wanna be filled with doubt",
    "I don't wanna be a good boy scout",
    "I don't wanna have to learn to count",
    "I don't wanna have the biggest amount",
    "I don't wanna grow up",
    "Well when I see my parents fight",
    "I don't wanna grow up",
    "They all go out and drinking all night",
    "And I don't wanna grow up",
    "I'd rather stay here in my room",
    "Nothin' out there but sad and gloom",
    "I don't wanna live in a big old tomb",
    "On Grand Street",
    "When I see the 5 o'clock news",
    "I don't wanna grow up",
    "Comb their hair and shine their shoes",
    "I don't wanna grow up",
    "Stay around in my old hometown",
    "I don't wanna put no money down",
    "I don't wanna get me a big old loan",
    "Work them fingers to the bone",
    "I don't wanna float a broom",
    "Fall in love and get married then boom",
    "How the hell did it get here so soon",
    "I don't wanna grow up"
