    "Rudy's on the midway",
    "And Jacob's in the hole",
    "The monkey's on the ladder",
    "The devil shovels coal",
    "With crows as big as airplanes",
    "The lion has three heads",
    "And someone will eat the skin that he sheds",
    "And the earth died screaming",
    "While I lay dreaming of you",
    "Well, hell doesn't want you",
    "And heaven is full",
    "Bring me some water",
    "Put it in this skull",
    "I walk between the raindrops",
    "Wait in bug house square",
    "And the army ants",
    "They leave nothin' but the bones",
    "And the earth died screaming",
    "While I lay dreaming of you",
    "There was thunder",
    "There was lightning",
    "Then the stars went out",
    "And the moon fell from the sky",
    "It rained mackerel",
    "It rained trout",
    "And the great day of wrath has come",
    "And here's mud in your big red eye",
    "The poker's in the fire",
    "And the locusts take the sky",
    "And the earth died screaming",
    "While I lay dreaming of you"
