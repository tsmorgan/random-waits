    "Inside a broken clock",
    "Splash the wine",
    "With all the rain dogs",
    "Taxi taxi taxi",
    "We'd rather walk",
    "Huddle a doorway",
    "With the rain dogs",
    "For I am a rain dog too",
    "I know how we danced",
    "And we swallowed the night",
    "Her long hair black as a raven",
    "I know how we danced",
    "And she whispered to me",
    "We'll never be going back home",
    "I know how we danced",
    "And we swallowed the night",
    "Her long hair black as a raven",
    "I know how we danced",
    "And she whispered to me",
    "We'll never be going back home",
    "Oh how we danced with the Rose of Tralee",
    "Her long hair black as a raven",
    "I know how we danced",
    "And she whispered to me",
    "We'll never be going back home"
