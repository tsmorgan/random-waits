    "Well ring the bell backwards",
    "bury the axe",
    "fall down on your knees in the dirt",
    "I'm tied to the mast",
    "between water and wind",
    "believe me you'll never get hurt",
    "now the ring's in the pawnshop",
    "the rain's in the hole",
    "down at the Five Points I stand",
    "I'll lose everything",
    "but I won't let go of your hand",
    "now Peter denied and Judas betrayed",
    "I'll pay with the roll of the drum",
    "the wind will tell the turn from the wheel",
    "the watchman's making his rounds",
    "well you leave me hanging",
    "by the skin of my teeth",
    "I've only got one leg to stand",
    "you can send me to hell",
    "but I'll never let go of your hand",
    "swing from a rope on a cross-legged tree",
    "signed with the one-eyed jack's blood",
    "from Temple and Union",
    "to Weyley and Grand",
    "walking back home in the mud",
    "I must make my best of the only way home",
    "Marley deals only in stones",
    "I'm lost on the midway",
    "I'm reckless in your eyes",
    "just give me a couple more throws",
    "I'll dare you to dine with",
    "the cross-legged knights",
    "dare me to jump and I will",
    "I'll fall from your grace",
    "but I'll never let go of your hand",
    "I'll never let go of your hand"
