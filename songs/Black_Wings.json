    "Take an eye for an eye",
    "Take a tooth for a tooth",
    "Just like they say in the Bible",
    "Never leave a trace or forget a face",
    "Of any man at the table",
    "Any man at the table",
    "When the moon is a cold chiseled dagger",
    "Sharp enough to draw blood from a stone",
    "He rides through your dreams on a coach",
    "And horses and the fence posts",
    "In the moonlight look like bones.",
    "Well they've stopped trying to hold him",
    "With mortar, stone and chain",
    "He broke out of every prison",
    "Boots mount the staircase",
    "The door is flung back open",
    "He's not there for he has risen,",
    "He's not there for he has risen",
    "Well he once killed a man with a guitar string",
    "He's been seen at the table with kings",
    "Well he once saved a baby from drowning",
    "There are those that say beneath his coat there are wings",
    "Some say they fear him",
    "Others admire him",
    "Because he steals his promise",
    "One look in his eye",
    "Everyone denies",
    "Ever having met him",
    "Ever having met him",
    "He can turn himself into a stranger",
    "Well they broke a lot of canes on his hide",
    "He was born away in a cornfield",
    "A fever beats in his head like a drum inside",
    "Some say they fear him",
    "Others admire him",
    "Because he steals his promise",
    "One look in his eye",
    "Everyone denies",
    "Ever having met him",
    "Ever having met him"
