    "Well pale face said",
    "To the eyeball kid",
    "She just goes clank and boom and steam",
    "A halo, wings, horns and a tail",
    "Shoveling coal inside my dreams",
    "There are no laws",
    "She's made of cream",
    "She's such a scream",
    "Qui bon tres bien, nails in cement",
    "A Donnie gal from mortal clay",
    "The plow is red",
    "The well is full, inside",
    "The dollhouse of her skull",
    "A cheetah coat fills up with steam",
    "She's such a scream",
    "All crooked lines",
    "Her fireplace",
    "A milktrain so clean",
    "Machine gun haste",
    "You'll ride the only wall of shame",
    "And drag that chain across the state",
    "Her lips are red",
    "She is the queen",
    "She's such a scream..."
