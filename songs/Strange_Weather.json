    "Will you take me across the channel",
    "London Bridge is falling down",
    "Strange a woman tries to save",
    "More than a man will try to drown",
    "And it's the rain that they predicted",
    "It's the forecast every time",
    "The rose has died because you picked it",
    "I believe that brandy's mine",
    "And all over the world",
    "Strangers talk only about the weather",
    "All over the world",
    "It's the same",
    "It's the same",
    "And the world is getting flatter",
    "And the sky is falling all around",
    "Oh and nothing is the matter",
    "For I'll never cry in town",
    "And a love like ours my dear",
    "Is best measured when it's down",
    "And I never buy umbrellas",
    "Cause there's always one around",
    "And all over the world",
    "Strangers talk only about the weather",
    "All over the world",
    "It's the same",
    "It's the same",
    "And you know that it's the beginning",
    "And you know that it's the end",
    "Once again we are strangers",
    "As the fog goes rolling in",
    "And all over the world",
    "Strangers talk only about the weather",
    "All over the world",
    "It's the same",
    "It's the same",
    "It's the same"
