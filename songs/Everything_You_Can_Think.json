    "Everything you can think of is true",
    "Before the ocean was blue",
    "We were lost in a flood",
    "Run red with you blood",
    "Nigerian skeleton crew",
    "Everything you can think of is true",
    "The dish ran away with a spoon",
    "Dig deep in your heart for that little red glow",
    "We're decomposing as we go",
    "Everything you can think of is true",
    "And fishes make wishes on you",
    "We're fighting our way up dreamland's spine",
    "With red flamingos and expensive wine",
    "Everything you can think of is true",
    "The baby's asleep in your shoe",
    "Your teeth are buildings with yellow doors",
    "Your eyes are fish on a creamy shore"
