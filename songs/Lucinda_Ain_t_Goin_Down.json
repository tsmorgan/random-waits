    "Well they call me William the Pleaser",
    "I sold opium fireworks and lead",
    "now I'm telling my troubles to strangers",
    "when the shadows get long I'll be dead",
    "now her hair was as black as a bucket of tar",
    "her skin as white as a cuttlefish bone",
    "I left Texas to follow Lucinda",
    "Nnw I'll never see heaven or home",
    "I made a wish on a sliver of moonlight",
    "a sly grin and a bowl full of stars",
    "like a kid who captures a firefly",
    "and leaves it only to die in the jar",
    "as I kick at the clouds at my hanging",
    "as I swing out over the crowd",
    "I will search every face for Lucinda's",
    "and she will go off with me down to hell",
    "I thought I'd broke loose of Lucinda",
    "the rain returned and so did the wind",
    "I cast this burden on the god that is within me",
    "and I'll leave this old world and go free",
    "the devil dances inside empty pockets",
    "but she never wanted money or pearls",
    "no that wasn't enough for Lucinda",
    "she wasn't that kind of girl",
    "now I've fallen from grace for Lucinda",
    "whoever thought that hell he'd so low",
    "I did well for an old tin can sailor",
    "but she wanted the bell in my soul",
    "I've spoken the god on the mountain",
    "I've swam in the Irish sea",
    "I ate fire and drank from the Ganges",
    "I'll beg there for mercy for me",
    "I thought I'd broke loose from Lucinda",
    "the rain returned and so did the wind",
    "I was standing outside the Whitehorse",
    "oh but I was afraid to go in",
    "I heard someone pull the trigger",
    "her breasts heaved in the moonlight again",
    "there was a smear of gold in the window",
    "and then I was the jewel of her sin",
    "they call me William the Pleaser",
    "I sold opium fireworks and lead",
    "now I'm telling my troubles to strangers",
    "when the shadows get long I'll be dead",
    "her hair was a black as a bucket of tar",
    "skin as white as a cuttlefish bone",
    "I left Texas to follow Lucinda",
    "I know I'll never see heaven or home",
