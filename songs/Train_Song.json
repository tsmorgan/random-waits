    "Well, I broke down in East St. Louis",
    "On the Kansas City line",
    "And I drunk up all of my money",
    "That I borrowed every time",
    "And I fell down at the Derby",
    "Now the night's as black as a crow",
    "Must've been a train",
    "That took me away from here",
    "But a train can't bring me home",
    "What made my dreams so hollow",
    "I was standing at the depot",
    "With a steeple full of swallows",
    "That could never ring the bell",
    "Oh I've come ten thousand miles away",
    "And I ain't got one thing to show",
    "Must've been a train",
    "Took me away from here",
    "But a train can't bring me home",
    "Well I remember when I left",
    "Without bothering to pack",
    "You know I up and left",
    "With nothin' but the clothes",
    "I had on my back",
    "Now I'm so sorry for what I've done",
    "And I'm out here on my own",
    "Must've been a train",
    "That took me away from here",
    "But a train can't bring me home",
    "It must've been a train",
    "That took me away from here",
    "But a train can't bring me",
    "Can't bring me home"
