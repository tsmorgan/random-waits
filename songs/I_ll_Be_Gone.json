    "Tonight I'll shave the mountain",
    "I'll cut the hearts from pharaohs",
    "I pull the road off of the rise",
    "tear the memories from my eyes",
    "and in the morning I'll be gone",
    "I drink 1000 shipwrecks",
    "tonight I'll steal your paychecks",
    "I paint the sheets across my bed",
    "the birds will all fly from my head",
    "and in the morning I'll be gone",
    "take every dream that's breathing",
    "find every boot that's leaving",
    "shoot all the lights in the cafe",
    "and in the morning I'll be gone",
    "I bet 1000 dollars",
    "I have a French companion",
    "I tie myself below the deck",
    "I pull the rope around my neck",
    "and in the morning I'll be gone",
    "it takes a life to win her",
    "there is a drum of bourbon",
    "800 pounds of nitro",
    "his boots are thunder as he plays",
    "there is a stone inside it",
    "tonight his bones will ride it",
    "I'll need a tent to hide it",
    "and in the morning I'll be gone",
    "and in the morning I'll be gone",
    "and in the morning I'll be gone"
