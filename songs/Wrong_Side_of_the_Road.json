    "Put a dead cat on the railroad tracks",
    "when the wolfbanes blooming by the tressel",
    "and get the eyeball of a rooster",
    "and the stones from a ditch",
    "and wash em down with bilge water",
    "and say you'll never snitch",
    "take the buttons from a yellow jacket",
    "the feather from a buzzard",
    "the blood from a bounty hunter's cold black heart",
    "catch the tears of a widow in a thimble made of glass",
    "tell your mama and papa they can kiss your ass",
    "poison all the water in the wishin well",
    "and hang all them scarecrows from a Sycamore tree",
    "burn down all them honeymoons put em in a pillow case",
    "wait next to the switch blades at the amusement park for me",
    "strangle all the Christmas carols scratch out all the prayers",
    "tie em up with barbed wire and push em down the stairs",
    "and I'll whittle you a pistol for keep the nightmares of the blinds",
    "them sunabitches always seem to sneak up from behind",
    "siphon all the gas from your daddy's pickup truck",
    "fill up Johnny's t-bird I got a couple of bucks",
    "put on a little perfume and wear ribbon in your hair",
    "careful that you don't wake up the hounds",
    "tear a bolt of lightning of the side of the sky",
    "throw it in the cedar chest if you want to tell me why",
    "bring me the gear shift knob from a 49 Merc",
    "lay down here beside me let me hold you in the dirt",
    "and you're gonna tremble",
    "tear the throat out of the night",
    "sink your teeth into my shoulder",
    "dig your nails into my back",
    "tell that little girl to let go of my sleeve",
    "you'll be a woman when I catch you come baby fall in love with me",
    "then with my double barrel shotgun and a whole box of shells",
    "we'll celebrate the fourth of july",
    "we'll do 100 mph spendin' someone else's dough",
    "we'll drive all the way to Reno",
    "on the wrong side of the road",
    "the wrong side of the road",
    "on the wrong side of the road",
    "the wrong side of the road",
    "wrong side of the road",
    "wrong side of the road",
    "hey baby"
