    "It's the same with men as with horses and dogs",
    "nothing wants to die",
    "Evelyn James they killed in a game",
    "with guns too big for their hands",
    "just off St. Charles in no man's land",
    "you'll have to find your own way home boys",
    "you'll have to find your own way home",
    "the oldest was Troy",
    "an eighteen year old boy",
    "shot dead in March in a robbery",
    "his brother started out to hell and to ruin",
    "Troy's killer was never caught they say",
    "young Nick he just went bad that day",
    "now he'll have to find his own way home boys",
    "he'll have to find his own way home",
    "why cook dinner",
    "why make my bed",
    "why come home at all",
    "out the door and through the woods",
    "there's a world where nothing grows",
    "it's hard to say grace and to sit in the place",
    "of someone missing at the table",
    "mom's hair sprayed tight and her face in her hands",
    "watching TV for answers to me",
    "after all she's only human",
    "she's trying to find her own way home boys",
    "she's trying to find her own way home",
    "my legs ache",
    "my heart is sore",
    "the well is full of pennies"
