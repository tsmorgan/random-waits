    "If you want money in your pocket",

    "a hot meal on your table",
    "and a blanket on your bed",
    "well today is grey skies",
    "tomorrow is tears",
    "you'll have to wait till yesterday is here",
    "Well I'm going to New York City",
    "and I'm leaving on a train",
    "and if you want to stay behind",
    "and wait til I come back again",
    "well today is grey skies",
    "tomorrow is tears",
    "you'll have to wait til yesterday is here",
    "If you want to go",
    "where the rainbows end",
    "you'll have to say goodbye",
    "all our dreams come true",
    "baby up ahead",
    "and it's out where your memories lie",
    "well the road's out before me",
    "and the moon is shining bright",
    "what I want you to remember",
    "as I disappear tonight",
    "today is grey skies",
    "tomorrow's tears",
    "you'll have to wait til yesterday is here"
