    "I should go out and honk the horn",
    "it's Independence Day",
    "instead I just pour",
    "myself a drink",
    "it's got to be love",
    "I've never felt this way",
    "oh baby",
    "this one's from the heart",
    "the shadows on the wall",
    "look like a railroad track",
    "I wonder if he's ever coming back",
    "The moon is a yellow stain",
    "across the sky",
    "oh baby",
    "this one's from the heart",
    "maybe I'll go down to the corner",
    "and get a racing form",
    "but I should probably wait here",
    "by the phone",
    "and the brakes need adjustment",
    "on the convertible",
    "oh baby",
    "this one's from the heart",
    "the worm is climbing",
    "the avocado tree",
    "rubbing its back against the wall",
    "I pour myself a double sympathy",
    "oh baby",
    "this one's from the heart",
    "blondes brunettes and redheads",
    "put the hammer down",
    "To pound a cold chisel",
    "through my heart.",
    "but they were nothing but apostrophes",
    "oh baby",
    "this one's from the heart",
    "I can't tell",
    "is that a siren or a saxophone",
    "but the roads get so slippery when it rains",
    "I love you more than all these words can ever say",
    "oh baby",
    "this one's from the heart"
