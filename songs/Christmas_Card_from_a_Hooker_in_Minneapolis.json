    "Hey Charlie I'm pregnant and living on 9th Street",
    "right above a dirty bookstore off Euclid Avenue",
    "and I stopped takin dope and I quit drinkin whiskey",
    "and my old man plays the trombone and works out at the track",
    "he says that he loves me even though it's not his baby",
    "he says that he'll raise him up like he would his own son",
    "and he gave me a ring that was worn by his mother",
    "and he takes me out dancin every Saturday night",
    "and hey Charlie I think about you everytime I pass a fillin station",
    "on account of all the grease you used to wear in your hair",
    "and I still have that record of Little Anthony and the Imperials",
    "but someone stole my record player now how do you like that?",
    "hey Charlie I almost went crazy after Mario got busted",
    "I went back to Omaha to live with my folks",
    "but everyone I used to know was either dead or in prison",
    "so I came back to Minneapolis this time I think I'm gonna stay",
    "hey Charlie I think I'm happy for the first time since my accident",
    "and I wish I had all the money we used to spend on dope",
    "I'd buy me a used car lot and I wouldn't sell any of em",
    "I'd just drive a different car every day dependin on how I feel",
    "hey Charlie for chrissakes if you want to know the truth of it",
    "I don't have a husband he don't play the trombone",
    "I need to borrow money to pay this lawyer and Charlie hey",
    "I'll be eligible for parole come Valentine's day"
