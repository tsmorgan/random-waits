    "The Ice Man's mule is parked",
    "Outside the bar",
    "Where a man with missing fingers",
    "Plays a strange guitar",
    "And the German dwarf",
    "Dances with the butcher's son",
    "And a little rain never hurt noone",
    "And a little rain never hurt noone",
    "They're dancing on the roof",
    "And the ceiling's coming down",
    "I sleep with my shovel and my leather gloves",
    "A little trouble makes it worth the going",
    "And a little rain never hurt noone",
    "The world is round",
    "And so I'll go around",
    "You must risk something that matters",
    "My hands are strong",
    "I'll take any man here",
    "If it's worth the going",
    "It's worth the ride",
    "She was 15 years old",
    "And never seen the ocean",
    "She climbed into a van",
    "With a vagabond",
    "And the last thing she said",
    "Was \"I love you mom\"",
    "And a little rain",
    "Never hurt noone",
    "And a little rain",
    "Never hurt noone"
