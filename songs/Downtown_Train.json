    "Outside another yellow moon",
    "Punched a hole in the nighttime, yes",
    "I climb through the window and down the street",
    "Shining like a new dime",
    "The downtown trains are full",
    "With all those Brooklyn girls",
    "They try so hard to break out of their little worlds",
    "You wave your hand and they scatter like crows",
    "They have nothing that will ever capture your heart",
    "They're just thorns without the rose",
    "Be careful of them in the dark",
    "Oh if I was the one",
    "You chose to be your only one",
    "Oh baby can't you hear me now",
    "Will I see you tonight",
    "On a downtown train",
    "Every night its just the same",
    "You leave me lonely, now",
    "I know your window and I know it's late",
    "I know your stairs and your doorway",
    "I walk down your street and past your gate",
    "I stand by the light at the four way",
    "You watch them as they fall",
    "They all have heart attacks",
    "They stay at the carnival",
    "But they'll never win you back",
    "Will I see you tonight",
    "On a downtown train",
    "Where Every night its just the same",
    "You leave me lonely",
    "Will I see you tonight",
    "On a downtown train",
    "All of my dreams just fall like rain",
    "All upon on a downtown train"
