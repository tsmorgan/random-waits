    "Romeo is bleeding but not so as you'd notice",
    "he's over on 18th Street as usual",
    "looking so hard against the hood of his car",
    "puttin' out a cigarette in his hand",
    "and for all the Pachucos at the pumps",
    "at Romero's Paint and Body",
    "they all seein' how far they can spit",
    "well it was just another night",
    "and now they're huddled in the brake lights",
    "of a '58 Bel Air",
    "and listenin' how Romeo",
    "killed a sheriff with his knife",
    "and they all jump when they hear the sirens",
    "but Romeo just laughs",
    "all the racket in the world",
    "ain't never gonna save that copper's ass",
    "he ain't never gonna see another summertime",
    "for gunnin' down my brother",
    "and leavin him like a dog",
    "beneath a car without his knife",
    "Romeo says: hey man gimme a cigarette",
    "and they all reach for their pack",
    "and Frankie lights it for him",
    "and pats him on the back",
    "and throws a bottle at a milk truck",
    "and as it breaks he grabs his nuts",
    "they all know they could be just like Romeo",
    "if they only had the guts",
    "Romeo is bleeding but nobody can tell",
    "sings along with the radio",
    "with a bullet in his chest",
    "and he combs back his fenders",
    "and they all agree it's clear",
    "and that everything is cool",
    "now that Romeo's here",
    "Romeo is bleeding",
    "he winces now and then",
    "he leans against the car door",
    "feels the blood in his shoes",
    "and someone's cryin' at the 5 Points",
    "in the phone booth by the store",
    "Romeo starts his engines",
    "wipes the blood of the door",
    "And he brodies through the signal",
    "with the radio full blast",
    "leavin' the boys there hikin' up their chinos",
    "and then they all try to stand like Romeo",
    "beneath the moon cut like a sickle",
    "and they're talkin' now in Spanish",
    "all about their hero",
    "Romeo is bleeding",
    "as he gives the man his ticket",
    "he climbs the balcony at the movies",
    "and he'll die without a whimper",
    "like every heroes dream",
    "like an angel with a bullet",
    "and Cagney on the screen",
    "And Romeo is bleeding",
    "Romeo is bleeding hey man",
    "Romeo is bleeding hey man",
    "Romeo is bleeding hey man",
    "Romeo is bleeding",
    "andele pues",
    "hey pachuco",
    "hey pachuco",
    "hago la lucha!",
    "dame esa pistola hombre",
    "hijo de la chingada madre",
    "ay que pinche pancho",
    "hey man",
    "hago la lucha",
    "hago la lucha",
    "vamos a dormir hombre",
    "hey man"
