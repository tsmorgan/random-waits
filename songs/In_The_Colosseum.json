    "The women all control their men",
    "With razors and with wrists",
    "And the princess squeezes grape juice",
    "On a torrid bloody kiss",
    "What will you be wearing there",
    "The lion or the raven hair?",
    "The flesh will all be tearing",
    "But the tail will be my own",
    "In the colosseum tonight",
    "This one's for the balcony",
    "And this one's for the floor",
    "As the senators decapitate",
    "The presidential whore",
    "The bald headed senators",
    "Are splashing in the blood",
    "The dogs are having someone",
    "who is screaming in the mud",
    "In the colosseum tonight",
    "Now it's raining and it's pouring",
    "On the pillaging and goring",
    "The constable is swinging",
    "From the chains",
    "For the dead there is no story",
    "No memory no blame",
    "Their families shout blue murder",
    "But tomorrow it's the same",
    "In the colosseum",
    "A slowly acting poison",
    "Will be given to the favorite one",
    "The dark horse will bring glory",
    "To the jailer and his men",
    "It's always much more sporting",
    "When there's families in the pit",
    "And the madness of the crowd",
    "Is an epileptic fit",
    "In the colosseum...",
    "No justice here, No liberty",
    "No reason. No blame",
    "There's no cause to taint the sweetest taste of blood",
    "And greetings from the nation",
    "As we shake the hands of time",
    "They're taking their ovations",
    "The vultures stay behind",
    "In the colosseum tonight..."
