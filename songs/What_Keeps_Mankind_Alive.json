    "You gentlemen who think you have a mission",
    "to purge us of the seven deadly sins",
    "should first sort out the basic food position",
    "then start your preaching that's where it begins",
    "you lot who preach restraint and watch your waist as well",
    "should learn for once the way the world is run",
    "however much you twist or whatever lies that you tell",
    "food is the first thing morals follow on",
    "so first make sure that those who are now starving",
    "get proper helpings when we all start carving",
    "what keeps mankind alive",
    "what keeps mankind alive",
    "the fact that millions",
    "are daily tortured stifled punished silenced and oppressed",
    "mankind can keep alive thanks to its brilliance",
    "in keeping its humanity repressed",
    "for once you must try not to shirk the facts",
    "mankind is kept alive",
    "by bestial acts"
