    "Rattle big black bones in the Danger zone",
    "There's a rumblin' groan down below",
    "Below the mine shaft roads it will all unfold",
    "There's a world going on underground",
    "Underground",
    "They're alive they're awake",
    "While the rest of the world is asleep",

    "Underground",
    "All the roots hang down",
    "Swing from town to town",
    "They are marching around",
    "Down under your boots",
    "Below the gopher holes",
    "Where they all unfold",
    "There's a world going on underground",
    "Underground",
    "Underground"
