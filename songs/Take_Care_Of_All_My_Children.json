    "Oh take care of all my children",
    "don't let them wander and roam",
    "take care of all of my children",
    "for I don't know when I'm comin' back home",
    "you can put all of my possessions here in Jesus' name",
    "nail a sign on the door",
    "bright and early Sunday morning",
    "with my walking cane",
    "I'm going up to see my lord",
    "oh keep them together at the sundown",
    "safe from the devil's hand",
    "you gotta make them a pillow",
    "on the hard ground",
    "I'll be going up to Beaulah land",
    "you can put all of my possessions here in Jesus' name",
    "nail a sign on the door",
    "bright and early Sunday morning",
    "with my walking cane",
    "I'm going up to see my lord",
    "remember you never trust the devil",
    "stay clear of Lucifer's hand",
    "don't let them wander in the meadow",
    "or you'll wind up in the frying pan",
    "you can put all of my possessions here in Jesus' name",
    "nail a sign on the door",
    "bright and early Sunday morning",
    "with my walking cane",
    "I'm going up to see my lord"
