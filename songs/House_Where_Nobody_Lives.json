    "There's a house on my block",
    "that's abandoned and cold",
    "Folks moved out of it a",
    "long time ago",
    "and they took all their things",
    "and they never came back",
    "Looks like it's haunted",
    "with the windows all cracked",
    "and everyone calls it",
    "the house, the house where",
    "nobody lives.",
    "Once it held laughter",
    "Once it held dreams",
    "Did they throw it away",
    "Did they know what it means",
    "Did someone's heart break",
    "or did someone do somebody wrong?",
    "Well the paint was all cracked",
    "It was peeled off of the wood",
    "Papers were stacked on the porch",
    "where I stood",
    "and the weeds had grown up",
    "just as high as the door",
    "There were birds in the chimney",
    "and an old chest of drawers",
    "Looks like no one will ever",
    "come back to the",
    "House where nobody lives",
    "Once it held laughter",
    "Once it held dreams",
    "Did they throw it away",
    "Did they know what it means",
    "Did someone's heart break",
    "or did someone do somebody wrong?",
    "So if you find someone",
    "someone to have, someone to hold",
    "Don't trade it for silver",
    "Don't trade it for gold",
    "I have all of life's treasures",
    "and they are fine and they are good",
    "They remind me that houses",
    "Are just made of wood",
    "What makes a house grand",
    "Ain't the roof or the doors",
    "If there's love in a house",
    "It's a palace for sure",
    "Without love",
    "It ain't nothin but a house",
    "A house where nobody lives",
    "Without love it ain't nothin",
    "But a house, A house where",
    "Nobody lives."
