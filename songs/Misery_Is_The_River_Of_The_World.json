    "Misery's the River of the World",
    "The higher that the monkey can climb",
    "the more he shows his tail",
    "Call no man happy 'til he dies",
    "There's no milk at the bottom of the pail",
    "God builds a church",
    "The devil builds a chapel",
    "Like the thistles that are growing",
    "Ã«round the trunk of a tree",
    "All the good in the world",
    "You can put inside a thimble",
    "And still have room for you and me",
    "If there's one thing you can say",
    "About Mankind",
    "There's nothing kind about man",
    "You can drive out nature with a pitch fork",
    "But it always comes roaring back again",

    "For want of a nail",
    "A shoe was lost",
    "For want of a life",
    "A knife was lost",
    "For want of a toy",
    "A child was lost",
    "Misery's the River of the World",
    "Misery's the River of the World",
    "Everybody Row! Everybody Row!",
    "Misery's the River of the World",
