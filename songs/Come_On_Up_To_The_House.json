    "Well the moon is broken",
    "And the sky is cracked",
    "Come on up to the house",
    "The only things that you can see",
    "Is all that you lack",
    "Come on up to the house",
    "All your cryin don't do no good",
    "Come on up to the house",
    "Come down off the cross",
    "We can use the wood",
    "Come on up to the house",
    "Come on up to the house",
    "Come on up to the house",
    "The world is not my home",
    "I'm just a passin thru",
    "Come on up to the house",
    "There's no light in the tunnel",
    "No irons in the fire",
    "Come on up to the house",
    "And your singin lead soprano",
    "In a junkman's choir",
    "You gotta come on up to the house",
    "Does life seem nasty, brutish and short",
    "Come on up to the house",
    "The seas are stormy",
    "And you can't find no port",
    "Come on up to the house",
    "(Chorus)",
    "There's nothin in the world",
    "That you can do",
    "You gotta come on up to the house",
    "And you been whipped by the forces",
    "That are inside you",
    "Come on up to the house",
    "Well you're high on top",
    "Of your mountain of woe",
    "Come on up to the house",
    "Well you know you should surrender",
    "But you can't let go",
    "You gotta come on up to the house",
    "(Chorus)"
