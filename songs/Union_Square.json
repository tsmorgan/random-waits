    "Well time is always money",
    "For the boys at Union Square",
    "You can bust your ass till doomsday",
    "But don't forget to say your prayers",
    "Someone's got a wad on the backstreet",
    "Sacc got a bran' new slack",
    "And your baby is handcuffed on the front seat",
    "Sit right there, boy and you relax",
    "I'm goin' down down down",
    "I'm goin' down down down",
    "I'm goin' down down down",
    "I'm goin' down down down",
    "Well they spill out of the Cinema 14",
    "To that drag bar down the block",
    "Best live show by far on the whole east coast",
    "With a bank rolled up in your sock",
    "She stand right there for your pleasure",
    "Half Puerto Rican Chinese",
    "You got to find your baby somebody to measure",
    "I'm goin' to get me some of these baby",
    "I'm goin' down down down",
    "I'm goin' down down down",
    "I'm goin' down down down",
    "I'm goin' down down down",
    "Four in the mornin on a Sunday",
    "Sacco drinkin' whiskey in church",
    "Half pint festival brandy",
    "That boy 'bout to fall right off his perch",
    "The guy in the sweaters off duty",
    "Out in front on the welfare hotel",
    "The guy in the dress is a beauty",
    "Go all the wayand I swear you never can tell",
    "I'm goin' down down down",
    "I'm goin' down down down",
    "I'm goin' down down down",
    "I'm goin' down down down"
