    "Little black girl in a red dress on a hot night with a broken shoe",
    "Little black girl you should've never left home",
    "there's probably someone still waitin' up for you",
    "It's cold back in Chicago but the Los Angeles street is worse",
    "all you got is twenty-nine dollars and an alligator purse",
    "see that vulture in the Fleetwood with the chartreuse hood",
    "sees you're tryin' to get your bearings",
    "say hey baby which way's the main stem",
    "wherever you say you're from he'll say he grew up there himself",
    "he gonna come on and make you feel like you grew up right next door to him",
    "take a left on Central he gonna throw it in reverse",
    "all you got is twenty-nine dollars and an alligator purse",
    "he gonna come on just like a gentleman",
    "and oh baby you're gonna be a little shy",
    "you say your ex-old man was a sax player",
    "he says Baby I used to play bass with Sly",
    "and you say you like his Cadillac",
    "says honey I got two or three",
    "sweetheart you're sure fortunate that you ran into me",
    "you've done a dime in the joint you figure nothin' could be worse",
    "than twenty-nine dollars and an alligator purse",
    "Got Pharoh on 8-track you start smokin' a little boo",
    "thinkin' gettin' out of Chicago was just about",
    "the best thing that's ever happened to you",
    "you startin' to like it already this cat seems to be cool",
    "he says Baby I know a good old jailhouse in West-Hollywood",
    "be just right for you",
    "he ain't no good Samaritan he gonna make sure he's reimbursed",
    "a lot more than twenty-nine dollars and an alligator purse",
    "and when the streets get hungry baby and you almost hear em growl",
    "someones savin a place for you when the dogs begin to howl",
    "and the streets are dead they creep up and take whatever's left on the bone",
    "and remember suckers always make mistakes",
    "when they're far away from home",
    "chicken in the pot whoever gets there first is gonna get themselves",
    "twenty-nine dollars and an alligator purse",
    "and the siren's just an epilogue the cops here always get there too late",
    "they always stop for coffee on their way to the scene of the crime",
    "they always try so hard to look just like movie stars",
    "but they couldn't catch a cold",
    "baby don't waste your dime",
    "she's lucky to be alive the doctor whispered to the nurse",
    "she only lost half a pint of blood twenty-nine dollars and an alligator purse"
