    "I must have brought the bad weather with me",
    "the sky's the colour of lead",
    "all you've left me was a feather",
    "on an unmade bed",
    "it's always me whenever there's trouble",
    "the world does nothing but turn",
    "the ring it fell off my finger",
    "I guess I'll never learn",
    "it's over it's over it's over",
    "I'm getting dressed in the dark",
    "our story ends before it begins",
    "I always confess to everyone's sins",
    "the nail gets hammered down",
    "it's over let it go",
    "so don't go and make a big deal out of nothing",
    "it's just a storm on a dime",
    "I've always found there's nothing",
    "that money can not buy",
    "I've already gone to the place that I'm going",
    "there's no place left to fall",
    "there's something to be said",
    "about saying nothing at all",
    "cause baby then it's over and it's over",
    "it's done forgotten and through",
    "story ends before it begins",
    "I always confess to everyone's sins",
    "the nail gets hammered down",
    "it's over let it go",
    "you got to let me go",
    "I wanna let it go"
