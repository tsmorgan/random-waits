    "Well, it's hotter 'n blazes and all the long faces",
    "there'll be no oasis for a dry local grazier",
    "there'll be no refreshment for a thirsty jackaroo",
    "from Melbourne to Adelaide on the overlander",
    "with newfangled buffet cars and faster locomotives",
    "the train stopped in Serviceton less and less often",
    "There's nothing sadder than a town with no cheer",
    "Vic Rail decided the canteen was no longer",
    "necessary there",
    "no spirits, no bilgewater and 80 dry locals",
    "and the high noon sun beats a hundred and four",
    "there's a hummingbird trapped in a closed down shoe",
    "store",
    "This tiny Victorian rhubarb",
    "kept the watering hole open for sixty five years",
    "now it's boilin' in a miserable March 21st",
    "wrapped the hills in a blanket of Patterson's curse",
    "the train smokes down the xylophone",
    "there'll be no stoppin' here",
    "all ya can be is thirsty in a town with no cheer",
    "no Bourbon, no Branchwater",
    "though the townspeople here",
    "fought her Vic Rail decree tooth and nail",
    "now it's boilin' in a miserable March 21st",
    "wrapped the hills in a blanket of Patterson's curse",
    "the train smokes down the xylophone",
    "there'll be no stopping here",
    "all ya can be is thirsty in a town with no cheer"
