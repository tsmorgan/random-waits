    "Hell above and heaven below",
    "All the trees are gone",
    "The rain makes such a lovely sound",
    "To those who are six feet under ground",
    "The leaves will bury every year",
    "And no one knows I'm gone",
    "Live me golden tell me dark",
    "Hide from Graveyard John",
    "But the moon is full here every night",
    "And I can bathe here in his light",
    "The leaves will bury every year",
    "And no one knows I'm gone"
