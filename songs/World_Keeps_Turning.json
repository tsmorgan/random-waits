    "On our anniversary",
    "There'll be someone else where you used to be",
    "the world don't care and yet it clings to me",
    "the moon is gold and silvery",
    "who knows where the sidewalk ends",
    "well the road will turn and the road will bend",
    "they always say he marks the sparrow's fall",
    "how can anyone believe it all",
    "well the band has stopped playing but we keep dancing",
    "the world keeps turning the world keeps turning",
    "on his hand he wore the ring of another",
    "the world keeps turning the world keeps turning",
    "we broke the bank and we tore up the place",
    "we disappeared oh without a trace",
    "now the sun it falls into the sea",
    "I know I'm the only one for me",
    "I was so green and the dress you wore was yellow",
    "the world keeps turning the world keeps turning",
    "the sun is down and the moon is in the meadow",
    "the world keeps turning the world keeps turning",
    "put a hat on your head",
    "will you paint the whole damn town red with me",
    "well the band has stopped playing but we keep dancing",
    "the world keeps turning the world keeps turning",
    "on his hand he wore the ring of another",
    "the world keeps turning the world keeps turning"
