    "my daddy told me looking back",
    "the best friend you'll have is a railroad track",
    "so when I was 13 said I'm rolling my own",
    "I'm leaving Missouri and I'm never coming home",
    "I'm lost and I'm lost",
    "I'm lost at the bottom of the world",
    "I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar",
    "I'm lost at the bottom of the world",
    "Satchel Pudding and Lord God Mose",
    "sitting by the fire with a busted nose",
    "that fresh egg yeller is too damn rare",
    "but the white part is perfect for slicking down your hair",
    "I'm lost and I'm lost",
    "I'm lost at the bottom of the world",
    "I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar",
    "I'm lost at the bottom of the world",
    "Blackjack Ruby and Nimrod Cain",
    "the moon is the color of a coffee stain",
    "Jesse Frank and Birdy Joe Hoaks",
    "but who is the king of all these folks",
    "I'm lost and I'm lost",
    "I'm lost at the bottom of the world",
    "I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar",
    "I'm lost at the bottom of the world",
    "well I dined last night with Scarface Ron",
    "on tilapia fish cakes and fried black swan",
    "razor weed onion and peacock squirrel",
    "and I dreamed all night about a beautiful girl",
    "I'm lost and I'm lost",
    "I'm lost at the bottom of the world",
    "I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar",
    "I'm lost at the bottom of the world",
    "god's green hair is where I slept last",
    "he balanced a diamond on a blade of grass",
    "now I woke me up with a cardinal bird",
    "and when I want to talk he hangs on every word",
    "and I'm lost and I'm lost",
    "I'm lost at the bottom of the world",
    "I'm handcuffed to the bishop and the barbershop liar",
    "I'm lost at the bottom of the world"
