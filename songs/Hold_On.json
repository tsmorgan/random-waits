    "So, she left Monte Rio, son",
    "just like a bullet leaves a gun",
    "With charcoal eyes and Monroe hips",
    "she went and took that California trip",

    "You gotta hold on",
    "Well, he gave her a dimestore watch",
    "and a ring made from a spoon",
    "Everyone is looking for someone to blame",
    "but you share my bed, you share my name",
    "Well, go ahead and call the cops",
    "you don't meet nice girls in coffee shops",

    "here with me",
    "Well, you build it up, you wreck it down",
    "you burn your mansion to the ground",

    "it's 10 below and falling",
    "by a 99 cent store she closed her eyes",
    "and started swaying",
    "but it's so hard to dance that way",
    "when it's cold and there's no music",
    "well your old hometown is so far away",
    "but, inside your head there's a record",
    "that's playing, a song called",
    "Hold on, hold on",
    "You really got to hold on",
    "Take my hand, I'm standing right here",
    "and just hold on."
