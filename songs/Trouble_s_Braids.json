    "Well I pulled on trouble's braids",
    "and I hid in the briars",
    "out by the quick mud",
    "stayin' away from the main roads",
    "passin' out wolf tickets",
    "downwind from the blood hounds",
    "and I pulled on trouble's braids",
    "and I lay by a cypress",
    "as quiet as a stone",
    "'til the bleeding stopped",
    "I blew the weather vane",
    "off some old road house",
    "I built a fire in the",
    "skeleton back seat of an old Tucker",
    "and I pulled on trouble's braids",
    "I spanked cold red mud",
    "where the hornet stung deep",
    "and I tossed in the ditch",
    "in a restless sleep",
    "and I pulled on trouble's braids",
    "I hung my rain-soaked jacket",
    "on some old barbed wire",
    "poured cold rusty water",
    "on a miserable fire",
    "I pulled on trouble's braids",
    "the creek was swollen by daybreakand I could just",
    "barely see",
    "and I floated downstream",
    "on an old dead tree",
    "and I pulled on trouble's braids",
    "I pulled on trouble's braids",
    "I pulled on trouble's braids",
    "I pulled on trouble's braids"
