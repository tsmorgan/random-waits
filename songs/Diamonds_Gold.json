    "The broken glass",
    "And the rusty nails",
    "Where the violets grow",
    "Say goodbye to the railroad",
    "And the mad dogs of summer",
    "And everything that I know",
    "What some men will do here for diamonds",
    "What some men will do here for gold",
    "They're wounded but they just keep on climbin",
    "And they sleep by the side of the road",
    "There's a hole in the ladder",
    "A fence we can climb",
    "Mad as a hatter",
    "You're thin as a dime",
    "Go out to the meadow",
    "The hills are agreen",
    "Sing me a rainbow",
    "Steal me a dream",
    "Small time Napoleons",
    "Shattered his knees",
    "But he stays in the saddle for Rose",
    "And all his disciples",
    "They shave in the gutter",
    "And gather what's left of his clothes",
    "What some men will do here for diamonds",
    "What some men will do here for gold",
    "They're wounded but they just keep on climbin",
    "And they sleep by the side of the road",
    "There's a hole in the ladder",
    "A fence we can climb",
    "Mad as a hatter",
    "You're thin as a dime",
    "Go out to the meadow",
    "The hills are agreen",
    "Sing me a rainbow",
    "Steal me a dream"
