    "Fairy tales can come true it can happen to you",
    "if you're young at heart",
    "for it's hard you will find",
    "to be narrow of mind",
    "if you're young at heart",
    "you can go to extremes with impossible schemes",
    "you can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams",
    "and life gets more exciting with each passing day",
    "and love is either in your heart or on its way",
    "don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth",
    "to be young at heart",
    "and as rich as you are it's much better by far",
    "to be young at heart",
    "and if you should survive to 105",
    "think of all you've derived out of being alive",
    "then this is the best part",
    "you have a head start",
    "if you are among the very young at heart",
    "don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth",
    "to be young at heart",
    "or as rich as you are it's much better by far",
    "to be young at heart",
    "and if you should survive to 105",
    "think of all you've derived out of being alive",
    "then this is the best part",
    "you have a head start",
    "if you are among the very young at heart",
    "if you are among the very young at heart"
