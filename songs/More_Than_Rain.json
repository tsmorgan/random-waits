    "It's more than rain that falls on our parade tonight",
    "it's more than thunder it's more than thunder",
    "it's more than a swindle this crooked card game",
    "it's more than sad times it's more than sad times",
    "none of our pockets are filled with gold",
    "nobody's caught the bouquet",
    "there are no dead presidents we can fold",
    "nothing is going our way",
    "and it's more than goodbye I have to say to you",
    "it's more than woe-be-gotten grey skies now"
