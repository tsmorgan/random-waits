    "I love the way",
    "The tattered clouds",
    "Go wind across the sky",
    "And summer goes",
    "And leave me",
    "With a tear in my eye",
    "I'm taking out my winter clothes",
    "My garden knows what's wrong",
    "The petals of my favorite rose",
    "Be in the shadows dark and long",
    "Though every year",
    "It's very clear",
    "I should be used",
    "To carrying on",
    "But I can be found in the garden",
    "Singing this song",
    "When the last",
    "Rose of summer is gone"
