    "It's too early for the circus it's too late for the bars",
    "everyones sleepin but the paperboys",
    "and no one in this town is makin any noise",
    "but the dogs and the milkmen and me",
    "the girls around here all look like Cadillacs",
    "and no one likes a stranger here",
    "I'd come home but I'm afraid that you won't take me back",
    "but I'd trade off everything just to have you near",
    "I know I'm irresponsible and I don't behave",
    "and I ruin everything that I do",
    "and I'll probably get arrested when I'm in my grave",
    "but I'll be savin all my love for you",
    "I paid fifteen dollars for a prostitute",
    "with too much makeup and a broken shoe",
    "but her eyes were just a counterfeit she tried to gyp me out of it",
    "but you know that I'm still in love with you",
    "don't listen to the rumors that you hear about me",
    "cause I ain't half as bad as they make me out to be",
    "well I may lose my mind but baby can't you see",
    "that I'll be savin all my love for you"
