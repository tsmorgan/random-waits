    "There was a murder in the red barn",
    "Murder in the red barn",
    "The trees are bending over",
    "The cows are lying down",
    "The autumn's taking over",
    "You can hear the Buckshot hounds",
    "The watchman said to Reba the loon",
    "Was it pale at Manzanita",
    "Or Blind Bob the racoon?",
    "Pin it on a drifter",
    "They sleep beneath the bridge",
    "One plays the violin",
    "And sleeps inside a fridge",
    "There was a murder in the red barn",
    "A murder in the red barn",
    "Someone's crying in the woods",
    "Someone's burying all his clothes",
    "Now Slam the Crank from Wheezer",
    "Slept outside last night and froze",
    "Road kill has its seasons",
    "Just like anything",
    "It's possums in the autumn",
    "And it's farm cats in the spring",
    "There was a murder in the red barn",
    "A murder in the red barn",
    "Now thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house",
    "Or covet thy neighbor's wife",
    "But for some",
    "Murder is the only door thru which they enter life",
    "Now they surrounded the house",
    "They smoked him out",
    "They took him off in chains",
    "The sky turned black and bruised",
    "And we had months of heavy rains",
    "Now the ravens nest in the rotted roof",
    "Of Chenoweth's old place",
    "And noone's asking Cal",
    "About that scar upon his face",
    "'Cause there's nothin' strange",
    "About an axe with bloodstains in the barn",
    "There's always some killin'",
    "You got to do around the farm",
    "A murder in the red barn",
    "Murder in the red barn",
    "Now the woods will never tell",
    "What sleeps beneath the trees",
    "Or what's buried 'neath a rock",
    "Or hiding in the leaves",
    "'Cause road kill has it's seasons",
    "Just like anything",
    "It's possums in the autumn",
    "And it's farm cats in the spring",
    "There was a murder in the red barn",
    "A murder in the red barn",
    "A murder in the red barn",
    "Now a lady can't do nothin'",
    "Without folks' tongues waggin'",
    "Is that blood on the tree",
    "Or is it autumn's red blaze",
    "When the ground's soft for diggin'",
    "And the rain will bring all this gloom",
    "There's nothing wrong with a lady",
    "Drinking alone in a room",
    "But there was a murder in the red barn",
    "A murder in the red barn"
