    "I met you in the saddle",
    "rode you in the dust",
    "held your hand to the heavens",
    "pulled your heart to the earth",
    "there was something that",
    "blinded me more than the mist",
    "the breath of the cottonwood",
    "buds lighter yet",
    "you rode the maypole of dance hall legs",
    "galloped to another's embrace",
    "I bit the flowers from your wrist corsage",
    "you waltzed too slowly",
    "too slowly you waltzed",
    "with that girl from Widow's Grove",
    "oh I'd follow you to the river",
    "that washes out to the sea",
    "through the wind through",
    "the rain of a cold dark night",
    "that's where I'll be",
    "near the breath of a swallow",
    "petals dropped as you fell",
    "you grabbed me then shyly",
    "held me against the stone cold well",
    "in your hand was a glass",
    "you held the ice against the night",
    "it dripped and it sparkled",
    "I laughed a wish",
    "before it all slipped down",
    "the dark tunneled well",
    "I heard it melt quietly",
    "I looked at you",
    "bent to the earth with",
    "just one pleading wish",
    "your skirts brushed to",
    "the furious pounding",
    "I'd follow you to the river",
    "that washes out to the sea",
    "through the wind through",
    "the rain of a cold dark night",
    "that's where I'll be",
    "I hid in the elm and raised the bough",
    "that hung even with your neck",
    "I chased you and drowned you",
    "there deep in the well",
    "when your mouth was full and wet",
    "I swallowed all your reckless fate",
    "with your last breath",
    "you moaned too drunk to wake",
    "I'd follow you to the river",
    "that washes out to the sea",
    "through the wind through",
    "the rain of a cold dark night",
    "that's where I'll be"
