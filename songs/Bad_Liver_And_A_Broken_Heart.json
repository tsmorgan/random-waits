    "Well I got a bad liver and a broken heart",
    "yea I drunk me a river since you tore me apart",
    "and I don't have a drinking problem",
    "cept when I can't get a drink",
    "and I wish you'd a known her",
    "we were quite a pair",
    "she was sharp as a razor",
    "and soft as a prayer",
    "so welcome to the continuing saga",
    "she was my better half",
    "and I was just a dog",
    "and so here am I slumped",
    "I been chippied and I been chumped",
    "on my stool",
    "so buy this fool, some spirits and libations",
    "it's these railroad station bars",
    "with all these conductors and the porters",
    "and I'm all out of quarters",
    "and this epitaph is the aftermath",
    "yea I choose my path",
    "hey come on Cath, he's a lawyer",
    "he ain't the one for ya",
    "and no the moon ain't romantic",
    "it's intimidating as hell",
    "and some guy's tryin to sell",
    "me a watch",
    "and so I'll meet you at the",
    "bottom of a bottle of",
    "bargain scotch",
    "I got me a bottle and a dream",
    "it's so maudlin it seems",
    "you can name your poison",
    "go on ahead and make some noise",
    "I ain't sentimental",
    "this ain't a purchase it's a rental",
    "and it's purgatory, hey",
    "what's your story, well",
    "I don't even care",
    "cause I got my own double-cross to bear",
    "and I'll see your Red Label",
    "and I'll raise you one more",
    "and you can pour me a cab",
    "I just can't drink no more",
    "cause it don't douse the flames",
    "that are started by dames",
    "it ain't like asbestos",
    "it don't do nothing but",
    "rest us assured",
    "and substantiate the rumors",
    "that you've heard"
