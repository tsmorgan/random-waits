    "When you walk through the garden",
    "you gotta watch your back",
    "well I beg your pardon",
    "walk the straight and narrow track",
    "if you walk with Jesus",
    "he's gonna save your soul",
    "you gotta keep the devil",
    "way down in the hole",
    "he's got the fire and the fury",
    "at his command",
    "well you don't have to worry",
    "if you hold on to Jesus' hand",
    "we'll all be safe from Satan",
    "when the thunder rolls",
    "just gotta help me keep the devil",
    "way down in the hole",
    "all the angels sing bout",
    "Jesus' mighty sword",
    "and they'll shield you with their wings",
    "and keep you close to the lord",
    "don't pay heed to temptation",
    "for his hands are so cold",
    "you gotta help me keep the devil",
    "way down in the hole..."
