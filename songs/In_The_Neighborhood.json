    "Well, the eggs chase the bacon round the fryin' pan",
    "And the whinin' dog pidgeons by the steeple bell rope",
    "And the dogs tipped the garbage pails over last night",
    "And there's always construction work bothering you",
    "In the neighborhood",
    "In the neighborhood",
    "In the neighborhood",
    "Well, Friday's a funeral and Saturday's a bride",
    "And Sey's got a pistol on the register side",
    "And the goddam delivery trucks, they make too much noise",
    "And we don't get our butter delivered no more",
    "In the neighborhood",
    "In the neighborhood",
    "In the neighborhood",
    "Well, Big Mambo's kickin' his old grey hound",
    "And the kids can't get ice cream, cause the market burned down",
    "And the newspaper sleeping bags blow down the lane",
    "And that goddam flatbed's got me pinned in again",
    "In the neighborhood",
    "In the neighborhood",
    "In the neighborhood",
    "There's a couple Filipino girls gigglin' by the church",
    "And the window is busted and the landlord ain't home",
    "And Butch joined the army, yeah, that's where he's been",
    "And the jackhammer's digging up the sidewalks again",
    "In the neighborhood",
    "In the neighborhood",
    "In the neighborhood",
    "In the neighborhood",
    "In the neighborhood",
    "In the neighborhood"
