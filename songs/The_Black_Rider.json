    "Come on along with the Black Rider",
    "We'll have a gay old time",
    "Lay down in the web of the black spider",
    "I'll drink your blood like wine",
    "So come on in",
    "it ain't no sin",
    "take off your skin",
    "and dance around in your bones",
    "So come on along with the Black Rider",
    "We'll have a gay old time",
    "Anchors away with the Black Rider",
    "I'll drink your blood like wine",
    "I'll drop you off in Harlem with the Black Rider",
    "Out where the bullets shine",
    "And when you're done",
    "you cock your gun",
    "the blood will run",
    "like ribbons through your hair",
    "So come on along with the Black Rider",
    "We'll have a gay old time",
    "Come on along with the Black Rider",
    "I've got just the thing for thee",
    "Come on along with the Black Rider",
    "I want your company",
    "I'll have the veal",
    "a lovely meal",
    "that's how I feel",
    "May I use your skull for a bowl",
    "Come on along with the Black Rider",
    "We'll have a gay old time"
