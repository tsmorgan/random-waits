    "I fell into the ocean",
    "When you became my wife",
    "I risked it all against the sea",
    "To have a better life",
    "Marie you're the wild blue sky",
    "And men do foolish things",
    "You turn kings into beggars",
    "And beggars into kings",
    "Pretend that you owe me nothing",
    "And all the world is green",
    "We can bring back the old",
    "days again",
    "And all the world is green",
    "The face forgives the mirror",
    "The worm forgives the plow",
    "The questions begs the answer",
    "Can you forgive me somehow",
    "Maybe when our story's over",
    "We'll go where it's always spring",
    "The band is playing our song again",
    "And all the world is green",
    "Pretend that you owe me nothing",
    "And all the world is green",
    "We can bring back the old",
    "days again",
    "And all the world is green",
    "The moon is yellow silver",
    "Oh the things that summer brings",
    "It's a love you'd kill for",
    "And all the world is green",
    "He is balancing a diamond",
    "On a blade of grass",
    "The dew will settle on our grave",
    "When all the world is green"
