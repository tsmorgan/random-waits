    "Well, my time went so quickly",
    "I went lickety-splitly out to my ol' fifty-five",
    "As I pulled away slowly, feeling so holy",
    "God knows I was feeling alive",
    "Now the sun's coming up, I'm riding with Lady Luck",
    "Freeway cars and trucks",
    "Stars beginning to fade, and I lead the parade",
    "Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer",
    "Oh Lord, let me tell you that the feeling getting stronger",
    "And it's six in the morning",
    "Gave me no warning, I had to be on my way",
    "Well, there's trucks all a-passing me, and the lights all a-flashin'",
    "I'm on my way home from your place",
    "And now the sun's coming up, I'm riding with Lady Luck",
    "Freeway cars and trucks",
    "Stars beginning to fade, and I lead the parade",
    "Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer",
    "Oh Lord, let me tell you the feeling getting stronger",
    "And my time went so quickly",
    "I went lickety-splitly out to my ol' fifty-five",
    "As I pulled away slowly, feeling so holy",
    "God knows I was feeling alive",
    "And now the sun's coming up, I'm riding with Lady Luck",
    "Freeway cars and trucks",
    "Freeway cars and trucks",
    "Freeway cars and trucks"
