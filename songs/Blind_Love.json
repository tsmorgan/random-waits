    "Now you're gone",
    "And it's hotels and whiskey and sad luck dames",
    "and I don't care if they miss me",
    "and I never remember their names",
    "they say if you get far enough away",
    "you'll be on your way back home",
    "well I'm at the station",
    "and I can't get on the train",
    "it must be blind love",
    "The only kind of love is stone blind love",
    "Blind love",
    "The only kind of love is stone blind love",
    "With your blind love",
    "With your blind love",
    "Stone blind love",
    "With your blind love",
    "Now the streets are turning blue",
    "and the dogs are barking",
    "and the night has come",
    "and there are tears that are falling",
    "from your blue eyes now",
    "Well I wonder where you are",
    "and I whisper your name",
    "The only way to find you",
    "is if I close my eyes",
    "I'll find you with my blind love",
    "The only kind of love is stone blind love",
    "It's your blind love",
    "The only kind of love is stone blind love",
    "Stone blind love",
    "Only kind of love is stone blind love",
    "With your blind love",
    "The only kind of love is stone blind love",
    "Stone blind love",
    "Stone blind love",
    "Oh it's blind love",
    "Blind love",
    "The only kind of love is stone blind love",
    "With your blind love",
    "Oh it's blind love",
    "Blind love",
    "With your stone blind love"
