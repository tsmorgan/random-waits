    "Well, there's one thing you can't lose",
    "It's that feel",
    "Your pants, your shirt, your shoes",
    "But not that feel",
    "You can throw it out in the rain",
    "You can whip it like a dog",
    "You can chop it down like an old dead tree",
    "You can always see it",
    "When you're coming into town",
    "Once you hang it on the wall",
    "You can never take it down",
    "But there's one thing you can't lose",
    "And it's that feel",
    "You can pawn your watch and chain",
    "But not that feel",
    "It always comes and finds you",
    "It will always hear you cry",
    "I cross my wooden leg",
    "And I swear on my glass eye",
    "It will never leave you high and dry",
    "Never leave you loose",
    "It's harder to get rid of than tattoos",
    "But there's one thing you can't do",
    "Is lose that feel",
    "You can throw it off a bridge",
    "You can lose it in a fire",
    "You can leave it at the altar",
    "But it will make you out a liar",
    "You can fall down in the street",
    "You can leave it in the lurch",
    "Well you say that it's gospel",
    "But I know that it's only church",
    "And there's one thing you can't lose",
    "And it's that feel",
    "It's that feel"
