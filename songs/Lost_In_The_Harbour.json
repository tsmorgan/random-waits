    "Over here the ladies",
    "All want sweet perfume",
    "But there's never a rose",
    "And over there",
    "The roses are frightened to bloom",
    "So they never can grow",
    "And over here they need wool",
    "For weaving baby's new clothes",
    "But nobody has any wool",
    "And the sheep are all lost",
    "In the harbour",
    "And over here",
    "They want diamonds to wear",
    "But there aren't any here",
    "And over there,",
    "Everyone's hiding their tears",
    "But they're crying inside",
    "And the wall won't come down",
    "Til they're no longer afraid of themselves",
    "If you don't believe me, ask yourselves",
    "And I can come down",
    "To the harbour",
    "And then I will fill the ocean",
    "Back up with my tears",
    "I still have a couple more years",
    "And then I can come back",
    "To the harbour"
