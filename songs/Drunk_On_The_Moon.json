    "Tight-slack clad girls on the graveyard shift",
    "'Neath the cement stroll, catch the midnight drift",
    "Cigar chewing Charlie in that newspaper nest",
    "Grifting hot horse tips on who's running the best",
    "And I'm blinded by the neon",
    "Don't try and change my tune",
    "Cause I thought I heard a saxophone",
    "I'm drunk on the moon",
    "And the moon's a silver slipper, it's pouring champagne stars",
    "And Broadway's(8) like a serpent pulling shiny top-down cars",
    "Laramer is teeming with that undulating beat",
    "And some Bonneville is screaming, it's way wilder down the street",
    "And I'm blinded by the neon",
    "Don't try and change my tune",
    "I thought I heard a saxophone",
    "I'm drunk on the moon",
    "Hearts flutter and race, the moon's on the wane",
    "Tarts mutter their dream hopes the night will ordain",
    "Come schemers and dancers, cherry delight",
    "As a Cleveland-bound Greyhound, and it cuts through the night",
    "And I've hawked all my yesterdays",
    "Don't try and change my tune",
    "Cause I thought I heard a saxophone",
    "I'm drunk on the moon"
