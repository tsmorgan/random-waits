    "I've grow up here now",
    "all of my life",
    "But I dreamed",
    "Someday I'd go",
    "Where blue eyed girls",
    "And red guitars and",
    "Naked rivers flow",
    "I'm not all I thought I'd be",
    "I always stayed around",
    "I've been as far as Mercy and Grand",

    "Broken windmill",
    "There's no wind at all",

    "Sky is red",
    "And the world's on fire",
    "And the corn is taller than me",
    "The dog is tied",
    "To a wagon of rain",
    "And the road is as wet as the sea",
    "And sometimes the music from a dance",
    "Will carry across the plains",
    "And the places that I'm dreaming of",
    "Do they dream only of me?",
    "There are places where they never sleep",
    "And the circus never ends",
    "So I will take the Marley Bone Coach",
    "And Whistle down the wind"
