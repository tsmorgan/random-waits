    "Well she's as mean as a needle",
    "don't get too close to the heater",
    "she's like a mean shop keeper",
    "who got an extra gun",
    "she about 6'4\" and she's a wrecking ball",
    "now go ahead and kiss her",
    "she brought the bad weather with her",
    "she got you coming through the dog door",
    "she got you coming through the dog door",
    "now pigs get fat hogs get slaughtered",
    "you ought to walk away",
    "well you can't but you ought to",
    "climb the rickety stairs",
    "she got the long black hair",
    "but don't sit there",

    "she's got ruin in her name",
    "but she can make it rain",
    "she's a small town jail",
    "and you're starving in the belly of a whale",
    "she got you coming through the dog door",
